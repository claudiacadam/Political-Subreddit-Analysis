I have never found an ounce of sense in right wing ideas, someone please attempt to show me why they are good.

I'll make a list of topics with a brief view point:



American insurance
----I have personal experience working and dealing with insurance companies, they actively lobby and push to rip off Americans. IMO there needs to be a good public option, healthcare should not prioritize money or shareholders.



Privitisation 
---- I've spoken to many right wingers that say the free market is the best for everything, they say it promotes ingenuity. I agree for alot of feilds, however its main goal is profit and in areas where the goal is the enrichment of society (school, healthcare, transportation) I have only seen negatives.



Abortion
---- non-issue.



Immigration 
---- historically a scape goat for internal problems and is no different today, non-issue.



Wealth inequality
---- rich people compound wealth generationally and create higher barriers of entry to lucrative feilds perpetuating a pooling of wealth towards a smaller and smaller group. Wealth is a product of you and your society, some people deserve wealth more than others but if someones wealth puts them into a position that compromises others rights it's an issue to me.



Environment
---- earth is big flask, change the form of dormant chemicals and swirl them around at an industrial level you will get dramatic changes that compound. Climate change denial is a huge reason why I have trouble understanding conservative view points.

No one here really wants your shitty diatribe about capitalism and how dumb you think Americans are and how much better your country is.

And if you preface your statement condemning our country with, ""Hello from your neighbor to the North, we are laughing at you""...we're just going to think you are an arrogant leaf.

If you want to lecture us about how much better le Europe is...we don't care.

If you want to say shit like, ""You die from lack of health care and can't get food at reasonable prices"" we will know that you are an ignorant idiot who has never been here, because compared to MOST places, food is CHEAP and plentiful here.

One page 3187, he‚Äôs first shown the lab-leak theory, and he sends it along to another researcher for more information

On pages 3147 and 3123 he receives emails with links to a study from India that claims the virus was spliced with HIV to spread more, but he debunks it and points out it‚Äôs not peer-reviewed, published, and didn‚Äôt stand up to replication. He links them to a debunking article.

On page 3087 he identifies for another researcher the background of the virus, explaining the likelihood of it coming from a bat and/or pangolin at a Wet Market.

Bonus: On page 1770 he reacts to merch made in his image.

mutklo,gvadyrz,"First of all calling it ""racist"" is a massive over simplification. Second it's not about the ID and it's never been about the ID. It's about intentionally excluding people, specifically young people and people of color.

For anyone unfamiliar with the process. On election day a registered voter gives a poll worker their name and address. The poll worker verifies that the person is in the registry for that polling place. The voter signs the registry affirming that they are the person in the registry, the poll worker signs as an official witness. The voter then received a ballot and can vote. 

The only type of vote fraud that voter ID has the capacity to stop is in person voter impersonation. And there has never been any proof that that type of fraud has ever been so problematic as to have effected the outcome of a single election. To say that it is ""uncommon"" is a massive understatement. 

Republican officials elected and otherwise have said on record that they win when it's harder to vote. They have said that voter impersonation does not happen.

Voting is the keystone to our republic and erecting barriers to the franchise serves only to keep power out of the hands of those who have already been excluded. 

Prove me wrong. Give me facts that in person voter fraud is so rampant that it justifies disenfranchising millions of eligible voters. OPINIONS DON'T COUNT, give me sources, arrests records, court proceedings, legal precedent. 

If you ban me or delete this comment you've only proven that I'm right.

Every down vote is a badge of honor.

Failing out... maybe your fault, maybe wealthy parents are more educated themselves and can afford to spend more time with their children teaching them. Maybe the schools in wealthy neighborhoods are better funded. Tough to tell.

Ancestors owning slaves... definitely not your fault.

Non republicans who come to our sub looking for a 'different perspective' [subvert that very perspective with their own views when they vote or comment.](http://i.imgur.com/XqL0wfR.jpg)

I'd like to THANK YOU for acknowledging that Fox is, in fact, a part of the media.

Usually if I *cite* Fox in response to something, I get numerous responses saying, ""Not FAUX NOOZE!""

I wonder how you live with the cognitive dissonance of simultaneously insisting that Fox IS on the level of CBS or ABC or USA Today while ALSO insisting that it cannot be trusted and should never be cited.

Mostly, I think you miss the point.  But many of you are very young.  You do not remember a time before partisan, divisive media.  You don't remember how media used to be... where your nightly news cast would report the major things that had happened across the nation and even around the world and would not curate content to be the thing that was most likely to ""rile you up"" and get you mad at one political party or the other.

Those of us who watch Fox watch it AWARE that it is going to give us news that we do not see other places... (because the major news embarrassingly avoids covering many stories these days) and Fox will give Republicans a fair shake in reporting.

You need to ask yourselves WHY Fox became so popular.  It's what... about 30 years old?  WHY do so many people watch it?  It's because the ""regular"" media became very partisan.  When an ALTERNATIVE popped up, people said, ""Okay...it's about time.""

And you also have to ask yourselves why you are so fixated and negative about Fox News, but you do not CARE that CNN or MSNBC are so biased...at least, not until someone posts a picture of a sign that calls them out.

The sad truth is that we really have no totally trustworthy and unbiased news sources in the USA anymore.  You have to watch them all in order to try to come to an understanding about what's happening.

So, don't get mad at Fox.  Because when you do this ... it's completely transparent.  You've been BASHING Fox since they went on the air and all they did was present an alternative to people.  The denizens of leftist subreddits actually want Fox SHUT DOWN because, ""My pappy was brainwashed by Fox and now he's constantly screaming about minorities and commies!""

If Fox could brainwash your Pappy...what makes you think that your constant diet of MSNBC, CNN, The Root, Salon, New York Times and Wapo hasn't brainwashed you?

All to protest a tax that the British government levied to repay debt they incurred defending the colonies and they even lowered the tea tax to the same as it was in the actual UK. Granted colonists had no representation, and I think the tea party was warranted. I can‚Äôt help but see similarities. 

I absolutely love this country, but the government is steady grabbing power, giving itself immunity, and incarcerating ppl at a staggering rate so for profit companies traded on the stock market can prosper.

I agree that robbing and looting are not the way forward, but how would you distinguish between opportunistic ass holes and actual protestors? 

Also when years of protest result in no action but a month of protests that are ‚Äúviolent‚Äù result in immediate change, it kind of seems like the government is teaching people that‚Äôs how to get things done. I‚Äôm just not sure what other option Americans have than to protest and sometimes cause a fuss. In the face of looming corporatism, blatant disregard for people‚Äôs freedoms in favor of large corporations, mass incarceration, and immunity for those that are supposed to serve and protect. 

True republican ideas favor less big government (besides the military) and this seems like a power grab, and way for the government to punish all those involved I.

However I also believe that those that are high risk such as my grandparents (70) (78) or other people over the age of 50 or those with underlying conditions. We all need to face the virus and gain herd immunity. To conclude far too many people are suffering from poverty and unemployment to continue this mandatory lockdown any longer.

Very few or no healthy people under the age of 50 with no underlying conditions have died from this virus. There are viruses that are far more deadly that we‚Äôre not quarantining for such as TB.

 Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States after tapping into populist American sentiment. Having led a career in business and television, he created an identity that was antitraditional government and put forth an ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù agenda. During his tenure, Trump appointed a record number of federal judges, including three Supreme Court justices. He brokered the Abraham Accords, significantly restricted immigration, and reduced government regulations. In February 2020, the unemployment rate was a record low at 3.5 percent. Throughout his term, he was impeached two times: the first on charges of abusing power and obstruction of Congress and the second for incitement of insurrection. He was acquitted by the Senate in both trials. This photograph of Trump, from June 17, 2019, was taken on the day before he officially announced he would seek a second term. The beginning of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which resulted in a devastating loss of human lives and an economic crisis, became a key issue during his reelection campaign. More Americans voted in the 2020 presidential election than ever before, and the majority elected Joseph R. Biden Jr. Nevertheless, Trump did not concede, and a mob of his supporters, who refused to accept the results, attacked the U.S. Capitol complex on January 6, 2021, when Congress was working to certify Biden‚Äôs win.¬†",,3,1620237989.0,False

rac¬∑ism

/ÀàrƒÅÀåsiz…ôm/


noun

prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.

This is the definition. Some people put a lot of weight on that last part and some don't. I'm guessing this person is heavily weighing on the last part. (Trying to explain this briefly) The idea as I understand it is that a minority cannot be racist against white people because they can't marginalize someone who's part of such a disproportionately larger group. I think they also take into account historic racism. 

So, think of an example where there's a society is 90 white people and 10 non white people. If 50% of each of those groups decides they aren't going to hire (or some other oppressive action) outside their race, white people probably aren't even going to notice. However, the non white people are going to have an absolute terrible time.

Playing up the politics is what cable news does to make more money, and we can't claim to be above it when we fall into the same trap, whether it happens here or in a mirrored fashion on r/politics.

The protest is about ending the cycle and the only way that can happen is if more accountability is legislated. That is the movement in a nutshell.

I personally feel cops should get a huge pay increase akin to doctors, especially with all they do and put up with. The caveat, if you make a mistake in arresting or shooting someone who by the court of law is found not guilt of the crime accused, then the cop should be fired after judicial review.

qugdh0,hl3pjhn,"I live in WI. This place is my home. What happened last year was an insurrection. Jacob Blake was NOT unarmed. He was attempting to kidnap a child. He was shot by police for trying to continue driving off with the child (while armed) and very much not in control of his emotions. The MSM decided to go with this narrative, based on a cell phone video of someone on a second floor apartment window, that Jacob Blake was another unarmed black man shot by police. That‚Äôs what started the riot. The event occurred on a Sunday afternoon. Between social media and MSM, that evening, hundreds of people converged on the apartments. ANTIFA-types threw a cinder block at an officer. Damage to police cars occurred. Monday, fires were started at various buildings. Tuesday, more of the same. It was not until Wednesday when the Governor (a real liberal loser) finally did something and called up the Guard. At that point, various right-wing groups called for volunteers to assist in protecting property from looting. 

Let‚Äôs look at Wednesday, ANTIFA/BLM gathered at the courthouse park area. They again engaged with police, they used incendiary devices on police vehicles/police. The police gassed the square and forced the rioters INTO the area being patrolled by the militias and Guard forces. This was deliberate by the police, since they couldn‚Äôt use deadly force (imagine that shit show) they sent them towards those who were armed and would likely use their weapons. Kyle Rittenhouse was attacked by several people. The event was chaotic. Rioters were now engaging the armed groups. After the shots occurred, the rioters left. The next day, there was mainly a smattering of small groups who were nowhere near as belligerent as they were before. It‚Äôs almost as though these ANTIFA fools actually realized, ‚Äúit‚Äôs no longer fun when I‚Äôm getting shot. I guess there are consequences for our behavior.‚Äù So they all packed up and left. 

Kyle Rittenhouse never should‚Äôve been placed in that position had the Governor called forth the Guard that Sunday when it was clear unrest was going to occur. He had zero excuse on Monday. He had even less on Tuesday. He waited days to make a decision that would‚Äôve rendered this entire thing moot. 

Kyle Rittenhouse displayed poor judgment in going, he‚Äôs not exactly a smart person, however, we cannot ignore that what he did, likely saved businesses from being burned. He‚Äôs not a hero, but he‚Äôs certainly not a villain.",,2,1637228553.0,False

Every Dumb election fraud theory is easily fact checked and proven false or misleading.
This is why we say there is no evidence of fraud- it's because the supposed evidence is either false, weak or a twisting of the facts.
Do you realise that Clinton could have come up with similarly shoddy evidence to explain why she could not have lost to Trump in 2016.

There are hundreds of democrats who believes the election was fraudulent then and could have sworn to that. And would have faced no legal jeopardy because there isn't any for swearing to an opinion.

They could have manipulated the statistics as they came out to point any anomaly, even if they were explained by real world events.

Trump is a liar who has claimed fraud so many times in the past.
Do you guys also believe Ted Cruz cheated him in the Iowa primaries like he claimed or was he full of shit then .

Some users were banned for breaking our subreddit rules.

>Exactly. Not sure why the OP even posted this with that shit narrative. It just makes r/Republicans and r/conservatives look like fools

The user who posted that was banned...because that's an attack on the OP of the submission.

The user also posted this:

>Now is the Conservative party going to apologize for the throng of people in their ranks who have spent the last 2 decades doing the same damn thing to Mexicans who immigrated here, legally, telling them to ‚Äúspeak English or get out?‚Äù

>This is clown bullshit.

This is clearly someone who is hostile and aggressive.  Melania speaks English.

In the modmail response to being banned, that user said:

>Fucking clowns, hope you like the exposure.

Which led me to click on their username to see that they had participated here and then linked this to subredditdrama.

One of subredditdrama's rules is:

>Avoid bias and do not submit drama you are directly involved in. Remain as neutral as possible; biased titles/self posts are grounds for deletion.

So...essentially, someone trolled here and broke the rules, got banned and then replied to their ban notice gloating about how they had gotten us ""exposure"" by posting on subredditdrama.

There has been a resulting downvote brigade and many, many brand new comments here as a result of that.

First off, I‚Äôd like to say that ‚Äúthe left‚Äù can be absolute garbage at messaging, which is also the understatement of the century. I feel like there is a sort of disconnect between the left and right so people are essentially talking past each other. While I‚Äôm sure that there are some stupid leftists saying that ‚Äúbad orange guy is directly responsible‚Äù in situations like this, that‚Äôs really not the issue at the heart of all this. When liberals reference systematic issues,  it is not really talking about the actors within that system. For instance, I feel like police are mostly great people who are not racist in the slightest. The system of law enforcement as a whole could be reformed in different ways to produce better outcomes for not just African Americans, but everyone. This could come in the form of better training and allocation of the system‚Äôs resources to increase the wellbeing of the police as well as the communities they serve. Police have been forced to take on so much in their communities I can‚Äôt even imagine how overwhelming it is. If there‚Äôs some sort of problem like drug overdoses, we as Americans just expect the police to deal with every aspect of it and that‚Äôs just not good for anyone. Anyway I hope that I was able to provide a clearer view of liberals here that go past the memes we make about each other. Let‚Äôs try to make America the best it can be, it‚Äôs our duty as Americans to keep this 243 year old experiment alive and well!

here's my source [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-30/donald-trumps-100-days-v-bidens-100-days/100091066](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-30/donald-trumps-100-days-v-bidens-100-days/100091066)

Just days after he took office, Trump used executive orders to issue a travel ban on seven majority-Muslim countries. There was confusion, and protests, at US airports and across the world.  
  
At the same time, Australian became an unwitting player as the world adjusted to the Donald Trump presidency when a feisty phone call between the US president and then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull became headline news.

Trump approved dropping the ""mother of all bombs"" on Islamic State militants in eastern Afghanistan. And he launched airstrikes against Syria in response to chemical weapons attacks ‚Äî while enjoying a piece of chocolate cake at his Mar-a-Lago resort with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  
  
The Russia investigation was also ever-present, with his newly confirmed attorney-general Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the investigation (a move Trump reportedly called ""disloyal"").  
  
Trump failed to pass a significant piece of legislation in his first 100 days. A bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) fell apart and was pulled from the House after it failed to win support from Republicans.  
  
It meant that Trump's first 100 days were defined by the actions he took on his own ‚Äî 24 executive orders, 22 presidential memoranda and 20 presidential proclamations.

this is by no means a complete list because i don't want to waste anymore time responding to someone who won't change there mind. there's a reason why I don't comment very often and that's because I HATE wasting time with a discussion that will only result in both of us being very mad.

So, the new take is that Biden's term started January 20, 2021, so the Trump count went til then. Never mind TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE A WIDELY AVAILABLE VACCINE.

Last count I saw Biden was trailing by a few tens of thousands of deaths. He's had vaccines available for almost a year, yet he is on par with Trump. So... Takeaway?

Death count WITH vaccines under Biden is creeping inexorably upward and will eclipse the previous administration numbers, at which point we can say that Biden should be taken at his word and be summarily expelled, impeached or otherwise removed from office for incompetence.

And we unfortunately just don't have a leader that has any skills in bringing the diverse groups of this  country together. So everyone is freaking out and responding to the crisis. Not condoning the violence by any means, just trying to understand it from a different  Lens. 

The flag is Supposed to represent freedom. When people are feeling oppressed, it makes sense that the flag is used to point out that there is injustice in our country. BUT with that said, the point of the flag is still obviously a symbol of freedom, especially when we have people fighting for that freedom in our military to this day.

But the people in this country are SO focused on arguing about all the nuances of how to protest or what symbols to use that we've become pitted against each other. This guy's point is that we need to come together. I agree.

They are instrumental in the process of the subversion only to destabilize a nation. When their job is completed, they are not needed any more. They know too much. Some of them, when they get disillusioned, when they see that Marxist-Leninists come to power‚Äîobviously they get offended‚Äîthey think that they will come to power. That will never happen, of course. They will be lined up against the wall and shot.""

Trump commits human rights violations on North Korean citizens everyday. Al Qaeda, Mujaheddin, Boko-Haram, Taliban; TRUMP.

Trump personally snitched on Anne Frank to Trump. The Jim Crow laws were passed by Trump, as well as the war on drugs. The partition of India was Trump's fault, as well as the resulting Kashmir issue. He also starred in the Cuban missile crisis and started the cold war.

Nuclear is an opportunity cost; it actively harms decarbonization given the same investment in wind or solar would offset more CO2

The combination of these technologies should be advanced as a solution to global warming, air pollution, and energy security. Coal-CCS and **nuclear offer less benefit thus represent an opportunity cost loss""**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2009/ee/b809990c#!divAbstract)

The industry is showing signs of decline in non-totalitarian countries.

>[""We find that an eroding actor base, shrinking opportunities in liberalized electricity markets, the break-up of existing networks, loss of legitimacy, increasing cost and time overruns, and abandoned projects are clear indications of decline. Also, increasingly fierce competition from natural gas, solar PV, wind, and energy-storage technologies speaks against nuclear in the electricity sector. We conclude that, while there might be a future for nuclear in state-controlled ‚Äòniches‚Äô such as Russia or China, new nuclear power plants do not seem likely to become a core element in the struggle against climate change.""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221462962030089X)

There is no business case for it.

>[""The economic history and financial analyses carried out at DIW Berlin show that nuclear energy has always been unprofitable in the private economy and will remain so in the future. Between 1951 and 2017, none of the 674 nuclear reactors built was done so with private capital under competitive conditions. Large state subsidies were used in the cases where private capital flowed into financing the nuclear industry.... Financial investment calculations confirmed the trend: investing in a new nuclear power plant leads to average losses of around five billion euros.""](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.670581.de/dwr-19-30-1.pdf)

The nuclear industry can't even exist without legal structures that privatize gains and socialize losses.

>[ If the owners and operators of nuclear reactors had to face the full liability of a Fukushima-style nuclear accident or go head-to-head with alternatives in a truly competitive marketplace, unfettered by subsidies, no one would have built a nuclear reactor in the past, no one would build one today, and anyone who owns a reactor would exit the nuclear business as quickly as possible.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2012/03/29/exelons-nuclear-guy-no-new-nukes/#3c8acf0a3c5d)

I‚Äôm not planning on voting for Biden at all and I made that decision long before he was the democratic nominee. He is arguably the worst choice out of all the Dems. He does not have a liberal voting record, he was chosen by Obama to appeal to moderates and the right, and he‚Äôs really clearly losing his mind.

I‚Äôm not going to vote for a candidate just because he has a D next to his name, because he shares almost no values with me. If the democrats want to get Trump out of office then they should have backed a candidate who was actually worth a damn.

Despite your views on Bernie Sanders, you can‚Äôt deny that he was easily the strongest candidate from the Dems. He has stood by his beliefs since he even got into politics, he speaks well and is not afraid to call out bullshit, he knows how to make people excited and how to appeal to them. If you put Bernie and Trump on a stage together then it‚Äôs gonna be a really good debate. It would get very heated, but there would clearly be passion from both sides and both candidates would have strong support from their bases. 

In an election between Bernie and Trump I would honestly say that it‚Äôd go either way. I personally think Bernie would have won but that‚Äôs my opinion.

Biden on the other hand would get destroyed by Trump in a debate. Trump plays dirty in debates and isn‚Äôt afraid to attack other people. Biden would crumble immediately and make a complete fool of himself. He can barely string together a sentence with screwing it up and now you got against Trump who doesn‚Äôt give a shit about playing nice. Biden would be destroyed. Bernie can hold his own and wouldn‚Äôt cave to Trump, Biden doesn‚Äôt stand a chance.

I‚Äôm pretty sure Trump is going to get a second term and honestly I say that he deserves it (I don‚Äôt agree with him at all and I don‚Äôt like the Republican Party, but the Dems fucked themselves over big time). It‚Äôs the same reason Hillary lost. She was a shit candidate who couldn‚Äôt generate any excitement among people.

#therightcantmeme can stop with the brigading.

If you think it's a bad meme and you aren't brigading from therightcantmeme... you can discuss WHY... but it's interesting that in your attempts to discuss WHY... you admit that it is something that can prompt discussion because you say, ""This would be better with the guy from Twitter instead of Zuck.""

But I'm not sure.  I'm seeing a LOT of people complaining on Facebook that discussing or posting about election fraud is getting their posts labeled with the fact check and often the fact-check doesn't even apply to what they posted.

Here's the issue with the fact-checkers.  They are LOPSIDED in how they decide what to ""fact-check"".  No it's NOT just that ""the left doesn't say things that need fact-checking.""

I'm willing to bet that on Facebook, you can post that ""Trump called Covid a hoax"" without getting that ""Fact check"" applied to your post.

But:

https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/08/ask-politifact-are-you-sure-donald-trump-didnt-cal/

That's been fact-checked.  It's something that Biden said repeatedly.  And MANY of the lefty fact checkers that the left relies on said, ""It's not true.  He did not say that.""

But still now it's almost gospel among the left.

They didn't like the fact checking SO MUCH that they actually PUSHED BACK on the fact-checkers so much that Politifact released ANOTHER fact-check to say, ""No, really ... he did NOT say that!""

But Biden kept repeating it.  The left says it constantly and it really is the epitome of The Big Lie.

I see the left posting things that aren't true on Facebook very often.  And I don't think I've seen a single one of them hit with the ""according to fact checkers"" thingy yet.

Take a fucken look at what his own family posted!!

Sessoms cousin posted that he loved the fact it was a white kid, it‚Äôs about time for revenge and more white deaths should happen.‚Äô

His cousin and girlfriend got death threats because of this. There was an investigation and it turned out it was his brother, Anthony, that posted it (who is on the run from Law enforcement), on his Facebook account.

In addition, have a look at all the fucked up comments, lies, stories and hashtags the family continued to post!!!

The difference here is the murderer has a voice, can say whatever the fuck he wants, can eat, can breathe etc.

Cannon does not have a voice, he can not tell us what happened, how he is feeling, he can not breathe..

We have to be his voice, we have to respond for him, we have to get his side of the story across..

I hope when the investigation and report is done, people can see how fucked up this really is...as I am disgusted about the amount of people who can not see it already with just the simple of facts given.

The Murderers family has a right to get his story across, say what they want etc. whatever....

However, not only do we have the same right, we have an obligation to a 5 year old boy to give him a voice beyond his grave and get his story across...

So, out of ~160,000,000 voters, *maybe* 0.000003% of them said they didn't like Harris; furthermore, we don't know where these people are from or how honest the poll is. We're better off reminding people that almost 50% of counted votes in the 2020 presidential election were against Biden/Harris, and even that isn't an incredible piece of evidence because we can't be sure how many of those voters were moderates and how they feel in Q2 2021.

Using these polls as ""evidence"" to say ""SEE! No-one likes Harris!"" is just silly and continues to make our party look.. well... silly.

I don't like Harris, my household doesn't like Harris, and I guarantee >90% of this entire sub doesn't like Harris, but in the grand scheme of things, none of those numbers really matter, and even if they did, Harris is still in office and her opposition isn't - nothing changes.

But if you want to talk about MAGA flags or Confederate flags...what about Biden flags or Pride flags?  Or even POW flags?

This isn't about waving flags when you are citizens.  This is about arguing for illegal immigrants to get amnesty or for open borders while you wave the flag of the nation that you CAME FROM like it's more important than.

>Term limits on members of Congress offer a solution to the brokenness we see in Washington, D.C

This won‚Äôt work the way people think it‚Äôs going to work. People think that just because you term limit Congressmen and Senators, it‚Äôs going to make them more responsive to their constituents and more likely to serve the interests of the American people instead of special interests. Based on what evidence does anyone think it will actually work this way? In reality, it will make the problem much worse.

First, as in any job, there is a learning curve, a period of time where you are useless and need to be trained, mentored, and led. That training, mentoring, and leadership is provided by the most senior and experienced personnel. There are also problems that pop up that no one knows how to solve. That is, except for those old guys who‚Äôve been around for 20, 30, 40 years and have seen it all and know it all. Once you term limit Senators to 2 terms and Congressmen to 3 terms, who are the most knowledgeable, senior and experienced people in DC going to be? Full time staff and bureaucrats. Senators and Congressmen will be completely dependent on staffers and government bureaucrats. These staffers and bureaucrats will not only become much more entrenched and much more powerful than they are today, they‚Äôll actually be the ones running things (just like Brussels does for the EU).

Second, once you term limit Senators and Congressmen, they know they have, at most, 6 to 12 years to ingratiate themselves to the special interests in order to rustle up that fat cat job they‚Äôll need when their short term government ‚Äúservice‚Äù comes to and end. So the special interests will become more powerful (and faster) than they are now.

Beware the rule of unintended consequences.",SilverHerfer,7,1546654211.0,False

There are three possible reasons this photo exists.

1. Biden is so dementia-ridden, senile, stupid, far gone, etc. to realize he's taking a photo with people wearing Trump merch.

2. Biden is just using this is an excuse to touch and sniff kids.

3. Biden doesn't care that the kids are wearing Trump merchandise, sees them as Americans, and decides to take a picture with them because he acknowledges that he's the a President of ALL AMERICANS, not just the ones who support him.

I'm seeing the first two points mentioned a lot and anybody who brings up the possibility of 3 gets downvoted or insulted.

Even though all logic, reasoning, and [Biden's own words](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-biden-viral-photo-trump-clothing-b1919346.html) prove 3 to be correct, you all would rather believe 1 and 2, because you're all so far down your political rabbit hole that you can't fathom somebody acting Presidential after the last embarrassing administration.

Yet with a steady beat  
Have not our weary feet  
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?  
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered  
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered  
Out from the gloomy past  
Till now we stand at last  
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast  
God of our weary years  
God of our silent tears  
Thou who has brought us thus far on the way  
Thou who has by Thy might Led us into the light  
Keep us forever in the path, we pray  
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee  
Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee  
Shadowed beneath Thy hand  
May we forever stand  
True to our God  
True to our native land  
Our native land

Remember Georgia ballots, they had a hearing where an analyst showed he had a method of determining whether a ballot was legal?  As soon as he was given permission to review ballots, there was nothing to review because the dems illegally shredded all of them.  Dems had already illegally shredded all the hard drives with the ballot images from voting machines.

i6mlu1,g0yq36t,"Good for them. These days I'm so grateful for the lone standing ball player or high school athlete, and especially for boys like this. 

What caused everyone to hate this country, I will never understand. We've done a lot of good for a lot of people. You can still work hard and do well here. You can still be a legal immigrant, and get citizenship here easier than most any other country, any people would want to go to anyway. You have the right to protest. Unfortunately, you no longer have the right to your opinion though. If you are against BLM, you are in real trouble. They made the fire houses take their back the blue American flags down off the firetrucks because it is in first opposition of BLM. So what?  Since when is BLM law?  That makes me sick. I live in Chicago. I would love to fly a huge back the blue flag at my house. However, if I did, my house would be destroyed, and myself and my tenants could possibly be hurt, actually likely be hurt. This is not the America I know and love anymore. My heart breaks a little more everyday for the country we have already lost, and for how much more we are going to lose. I still have a glimmer of hope, but I have to be realistic. 

We have now seen that it is okay and widely accepted to talk about white people needing to die in order for black people to heal. What do black people need to heal from anyway, all their handouts, their servere case of laziness, what???  I live close enough to the west side to encounter those scumbsgs over there regularly. They do not want to work!  They do not want better lives. They just want more money & stuff!  They want to have babies and that's it. The only way any of this will ever change is if it starts with family. Children need to be taught from a young age the value of hard work & the dollar. They don't respect anything because they've never earned a darn thing. Dems are crying for more handouts. That will only push them further out of reach of any actual change & success. I believe that young black men & women could be whatever they want to be, but they have seen their parents get checks their entire lives, a voucher for a free house, etc.  So, that is what they do. It's extremely difficult to discipline yourself as an adult. It really is. Occasionally, an exceptional black person does it, and they get out of the ghetto and make something of themselves. However, the norm and the majority do not. How are they preaching all this change, and they only want to increase handouts to black people?  Socialism does NOT work!  Plain & simple. People that do work hard, do not want to give 70% of their check away. And why should they. Everyone just ends up quitting and giving up for the free check, so then where does the money come from. They think the government is this magical entity that has these infinite funds. The country and economy has already suffered tremendous blows. If everything bounced back right now, maybe we could survive. However, that is not going to happen. These lazy idiot young white brats are the root of the problem, out there fighting when they don't even understand. They are so dumb. All the moronic hippies are academics now so we're screwed at that front too. America is gone. It will never be what it once was. I am 41, and most of my ""friends"" are total idiots. I don't even speak to most of them anymore because they actually hate me for not backing BLM. They were my friends from childhood. That's insane to me. I have one real friend, and that's it. I used to have tons, and I was super social, going out all the time, getting everyone into all the fancy bars & clubs, etc.  Now, those people will not speak to me. I've never really said much either. I just said that the actions of one bad man do not warrant any of this. Basically 99% of the time, the cops do the right thing. Of course there are a few bad apples, but that has nothing to do with the police force, and everything to do with an individual being a POS. There are POS's in every profession, in every race, in every walk of life. That doesn't mean it has anything to do with what they do (drug dealers aside). The guy that spit a giant lugie into a police officers coffee in a Dunkin Donuts in Chicago had no charges filed. Our (c u next Tuesday) DA refuses to charge him. She has no right to bring her personal thoughts and feelings into what cases she brings forward. If I were that cop, I would sue her personally. How dare she!  It was on camera!  Do you know how disgusting that is. Thank goodness he took the lid off for the coffee to cool. These are men & women that devote their lives to protecting us, and they way they are being treated is truly heartbreaking. I honestly can't take it anymore. I cry every single day. I want so badly to voice my opinions, but I can't because I don't want my family to be hurt. I feel like I'm living in communist Russia back in the 70's or 80's. This is America. How can this be happening. How can we go from being this free & wonderful nation to becoming one where we live in fear for what we believe?  This needs to stop, and it needs to stop now!

USA can cut off RU oil bc we use very little of it...

Germany & Europe are dependant on it. Over 40% of their Energy is supplied by RU.

Also different parts of  world have different types of Crude.

Talking to Venezuela & Iran & Others...

Are trying to make up for Supply if RU oil was cutoff from Germany & EU...

Gop & Dems need to look at increasing production if energy at every level to help Deliver energy for Europe's needs.  It could take years to be able to do this.. everything must be on the table incl Nuclear power! Germany said no to nuclear & are held hostage by RU oil. .

Now is not time to play politics. Now is time for solutions & working together w allies & making a long term plan.

Quit acting  like USA can just flip a switch & supply Europe with all their energy needs. I assure you that's not the case.  We can increase production & offset RU USA imports but that's nothing bc we take such few RU oil.

ny4i4y,h1ion2b,"Well. Fucking. Said. 

Prolly never happen though. Fact is every political sub on reddit that claims to have an 'unbiased' mod team is openly lying. They know it and don't care.

r/politics-media on media is 'off topic' (unless it's critical of FoxNews)


Hunter Biden? He's not involved in politics (biggest lie on reddit)


Global Warming? Submissions challenging the veracity are verboten. All else is good


r/politicalhumor-submission removed and users banned if they dare not please omnigod donkeyballs. 99% of Branco cartoons removed


r/news-be afraid, very afraid. Nothing outside the hivemind is allowed there

It's not just the submissions it's comments. You can post the most vile personal attacks as long as it is against a conservative but if they decide to ban you they'll comb through months of your history to find a single untoward comment and then claim it breaks a rule. 

Established mods of these and others subs are weak-minded people who think they're doing their part to advance the cause but they're really just assuaging some deep seated emotional needs that stem from a lack of control in their own personal lives.

My hope is that newer mods can keep their heads down, bide their time, toe the liberal line until they achieve the seniority needed to take back control over left hypocrite ideologues and make these subs an open and honest place for the free exchange of ideas.",,14,1623508197.0,False

Also, left leaning people  obtain degrees at a much higher rate than conservatives, which adds a layer of entitlement to their argument. There is a belief in the progressive community that they‚Äôre more educated by comparison. Conservatives have to be at their best at all times to combat both of these factors. For instance, I noticed you used there instead of their in your post. That‚Äôs the kind of opening  they‚Äôd look for to say ‚Äúhe/she is an ignorant buffoon and I don‚Äôt need to engage in this discourse with them.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with your argument or that you simply made a mistake, it‚Äôs that you have to play by a more stringent set of rules as a conservative. Unfortunately that‚Äôs the way it is now. If you don‚Äôt want to be mobbed you have to recite your arguments, practice making your points in an eloquent manner, and do not get emotional.

They usually don‚Äôt like it, but at that point I can throw it back on them if they don‚Äôt do any of it. Act with kindness, grace, and stability in your life, and they‚Äôll get curious.

And you can't just point to the fact that there aren't any more laws that say ""whites can do X and blacks can't"" and say that everything is solved. There's a massive amount of history, hate, and discrimination that has been proven time and time again both in social examples and in courts, that is still going on. I have a friend who's parents are a mixed race couple. They tell a story about trying to find an apartment after a military move in the 1980s. When they went together, they were denied again and again, or told there were no vacancies. But when the white woman of the couple approached the exact same landlords a week later, she had free access to any of the apartments they wanted. This kind of thing happens CONSTANTLY.

Not only that, but the whole argument is predicated on a misconception of what ""white guilt"" is. What we need to have, is an understanding that we, as white people, have privilege that other folks don't. That's not discounting the struggles that some white individuals have had to overcome, just that the addition of doors being closed for you simply because you are black, such as the additional trouble of finding an apartment.

Can we first agree that there is \*real\* scientific debate over when exactly life begins? As in, there's no exact agreed-upon definition. So with \*that\* said, can we agree that the point at which life begins is a hard scientific gray area?

Either millions of ""potential"" lives are cut off for a myriad of reasons up to and including pure convenience of the ""mother"". 

OR  
We are allowing mass genocide in numbers that are unfathomable.

oq6r7w,h6carim,"Being completely honest, I do think that Biden was able to get 81 million ‚Äúvotes‚Äù; however, I am quite certain there was some nefarious actions taken to get that many votes. Put simply, I think the DNC used Covid as an excuse to create a massive ballot harvesting program. This is notable because these massive mail-in jumps only happened in states like MI, WI, PA, and GA that had questionable Covid laws, other ‚Äúswing states‚Äù like Iowa and Florida, which didn‚Äôt have such extreme changes, didn‚Äôt see these same jumps. Plus, we know there was ballot harvesting since some harvesters in Minneapolis were posting what they were doing.

Also, these massive vote jumps didn‚Äôt come from all across the states, they were always bunched up in dense cities like Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Atlanta, some times entirely within one precinct. What I feel is the most likely case is the DNC used targeted data to go out to these cities, and find uninformed voters, who wouldn‚Äôt have voted otherwise, to vote Biden.

Also, looking at down-ballot races, most places that had this large late-night swing didn‚Äôt see much if any benefit. Comparing the presidential and senate races in MI, the margin for Biden was noticeably larger than the lead for Sen Peters, despite Peters being a relatively popular incumbent. This leads me to believe that there were many uninformed voters that would have only voted for the presidential race.

The most nefarious part of this could be the coverup. In just about every one of these cities something damning happened. Detroit has the poll workers blocking the windows. Philadelphia had the official poll watchers being denied access to the polling stations. Atlanta had pipe burst (that never actually happened). My thought is that some of these could have been orchestrated as a way to throw people off the correct trail, though this is probably the least likely part of the theory.

It looks like Biden restored the American aid to UNRWA out of pure populism.

Why did Republicans at every level outperform and win more elections, but Trump lost to Biden? It wasn‚Äôt fraud. It‚Äôs because people like small government ideals but don‚Äôt like him.

Sotomayor entered Princeton University on a full scholarship,[31] by her own later description gaining admission in part due to her achievements in high school and in part because affirmative action made up for her standardized test scores not being fully comparable to those of other applicants.[32][33] She would later say that there are cultural biases built into such testing[32] and praise affirmative action for fulfilling ""its purpose: to create the conditions whereby students from disadvantaged backgrounds could be brought to the starting line of a race many were unaware was even being run.""[34]

She would describe her time at Princeton as a life-changing experience.[35] Initially, she felt like ""a visitor landing in an alien country""[36] as her exposure had been limited to the Bronx and Puerto Rico.[37] Princeton had few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20).[13][38] She was too intimidated to ask questions during her freshman year;[36] her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics.[39] She put in long hours in the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside of class, and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence.[13][38][39] She became a moderate student activist[30][40] and co-chair of the Acci√≥n Puertorrique√±a organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more opportunities for Puerto Rican students.[13][41][42] She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects.[43]

As an activist, Sotomayor focused on faculty hiring and curriculum, since Princeton did not have a single full-time Latino professor nor any class on Latin American studies.[44][45] A meeting with university president William G. Bowen in her sophomore year saw no results,[42] leading to Sotomayor's saying in a New York Times story at the time that ""Princeton is following a policy of benign neutrality and is not making substantive efforts to change.""[46] So, Acci√≥n Puertorrique√±a filed a formal letter of complaint in April 1974 with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, saying the school discriminated in its hiring and admission practices.[41][44][46] Sotomayor wrote opinion pieces for the Daily Princetonian with the same theme.[13] The university began to hire Latino faculty,[40][44] and Sotomayor established an ongoing dialogue with Bowen.[43] Sotomayor also successfully persuaded historian Peter Winn to create a seminar on Puerto Rican history and politics.[44] Sotomayor joined the governance board of Princeton's Third World Center and served on the university's student‚Äìfaculty Discipline Committee, which issued rulings on student infractions.[43][47] She also ran an after-school program for local children[40] and volunteered as an interpreter for Latino patients at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital.[13][37][48]

Sotomayor's 1976 Princeton yearbook photo
Academically, Sotomayor stumbled her first year at Princeton,[37] but later received almost all A's in her final two years of college.[47] Sotomayor wrote her senior thesis at Princeton on Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, and on the territory's struggles for economic and political self-determination.[13] The 178-page work, ""La Historia Ciclica de Puerto Rico: The Impact of the Life of Luis Mu√±oz Marin on the Political and Economic History of Puerto Rico, 1930‚Äì1975"",[49] won honorable mention for the Latin American Studies Thesis Prize.[50] As a senior, Sotomayor won the Pyne Prize, the top award for undergraduates, which reflected both strong grades and extracurricular activities.[13][30][47] In 1976, she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa[13][51] and graduated summa cum laude with an A.B. in history.[52] She was influenced by critical race theory, which would be reflected in her later speeches and writings.[53]",TheSecond48,0,1641864363.0,False

So Sanders could have already done his analysis on Kavanaugh before he was chosen. 
Although I will concede that he and the rest of the dems would have opposed no matter who the nominee was. 
But the republicans are the same. 
Lindsey Graham praised Garland : He‚Äôs a very nice man. He‚Äôs, I think, an honest, very capable judge,‚Äù Graham told reporters after his sit-down with Garland. He noted that Garland ‚Äúworked well‚Äù with current Chief Justice John Roberts when both men were on the D.C. Circuit Court, ‚Äúso there‚Äôs no beef with him. Well-qualified man.‚Äù 
Although Republicans did something similar to Garland in stalling his nomination for over a year. 
Are the allegations against Kavanaugh true? I don‚Äôt know. Are the Dems using this as a stalling tactic not caring (at least for some) wether the allegations are true or not? Yes. 
I don‚Äôt think we should be surprised that the politicians are playing politics here, especially when both sides do it.

He also alienated the working people who made up the base of the Democratic Party which eventually lead to Trump. When people feel like they have no voice in their own government they tune out, but they show up to vote when anti-establishment candidates make it onto the ballot. If Bernie had won the nomination in 2016 I believe these people would have over a few election cycles gone back to their political home in the Dem party.

Some states (e.g. Texas and Georgia) didn't follow lockdown rules and opened too early.  On top of that you never really had full mask usage.  People started tiring of the changes in behavior and began going to gatherings and not wearing masks.  Then cases started rising again.  If people don't do the easy things, then we are pushed to do the hard things. We are also not performing large scale contact tracing and are not testing nearly enough to provide the details of transmission that would greatly benefit public health officials.  We need millions of tests per day for that.  The U.S. is the greatest offender in number of cases and deaths.  If 95% of people wore masks consistently (not under your nose or chin) in the presence of others, a lockdown would probably not even be needed.

There is a lot of messaging by Democrats saying ""you want to kill Grandma"" and a lot of messaging by Republicans talking about the low rate of death for those under 80

Both of these miss the point that this virus spreads exponentially- the spread of the virus is extremely fast, insanely so, to the point where it overwhelms our local healthcare. This is the real threat of the virus. One of the reasons our survival rate of this virus has been good so far is due to the fact that those whom need vents can get them, those who need to be treated can be treated.

However, if we just open up, unmask, disregard the spread of the virus- every city will start looking like New York, Texas, California in no time at all. People will start dying from completely unrelated diseases due to triage. Due to the overwhelming amount of cases, some of our healthcare workers will inevitably catch the disease and have to stop working, causing a waterfall effect of us having an understaffed hospital while also being an overwhelmed hospital at normal functionality.

This isn't a political issue but has been made one. Quit believing those who would tell you this is no big deal, because it is- however, the messaging on both sides has been pretty poor for the most part.

I have a history of many generations of military service, even back when blacks could not fight but were used as pack mules and servants.  My ancestors died in wars and returned home to die in protest.  The cup of tolerance can run over to the point that the symbols used to represent an ideal can become a direct attack on those not privy to the freedoms they are supposed to represent. At some point protest must and will escalate if change is not happening or happening swift enough.  The idea of bringing your grievances to the table is a little disingenuous, as the issues being voiced are the same that have been voiced for centuries.  albeit I must acknowledge at a much lesser degree.  My question would be how could the burning of a symbol, the flag, receive more outrage than the killing of a human?  Or even the discrimination against a fellow citizen?  In my mind all those that oppose flag burning so vigorously should be on the front lines speaking out against any injustice done in the name of the flag.  Why does this disconnect exist?

Science does not rely on consensus, majority rule or opinion. Either the data confirms the assumptions and is repeatable or it isn‚Äôt. Shouting down, shaming or ostracizing professionals with differing assumptions is archaic and deeply anti-science. 

Science is not a religion to believed or disbelieved and it‚Äôs not a deity that is real or fake, it is the process of understanding our world. 

There have been many consensus of assumptions throughout time that have been challenged by minority voices. Just think of where we would be if the consensus was still the Earth is flat or that the white race was superior to others. 

The types of societies that suppress the voices of the minority are not societies built around an appreciation for science. They are corrupt and they are dangerous. Minority voices are the ones that have made the big scientific breakthroughs throughout history. The ones who challenge the status quo and push the boundaries. 

That is why it is so paramount that these voices be heard, respected and given the opportunity to conduct research and review free from harassment and shame. This is the unequivocal death of science in this country. Regardless of your personal political leanings this is unacceptable.

Edit: Since people keep saying CRT isn‚Äôt in South Africa, the concepts are taught there:

1. Whites are bad people. 
2. Whites stole their land. 
3. Whites owe blacks reparations
4. Whites (and Indians) are the reasons blacks are still in poverty despite whites being out of power for 26 years. 

Let‚Äôs go through it.

It is the history of apartheid that is why Black South Africans are failing at education. 

https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/02/south-africa-broken-and-unequal-education-perpetuating-poverty-and-inequality/

Never mind that 26 years of the ANC in power never fixed it. AI blames it on apartheid. 

Just for American comparison:

Literally, it has all the same talking points as CRT in the US. Also what is in common between BLM and the leaders of the ANC? Trained Marxists.

Once you read it you realise these are not the same stories and are not comparable.

The latter doesn't work for the NHS anymore anyway and was working for the government, the Department for Work an Pensions, as a disability assessor. He can still be a doctor. He simply lost his non-NHS job.

From the Telegraph article:

>Dr David Mackereth has worked for 26 years as an NHS doctor but was told he could not be employed as a [Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) ](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions)disability assessor if he refused to identify patients as being of a sex that they did not see themselves as.

One story is a doctor who made a mistake and was allowed to work again. The latter is a doctor who stopped working as a doctor and was working in a quite different role and refused to do something the employer required him to do as an employee because their lawyers told them it was a legal requirement. He was not even sacked/fired, he told his employers he couldn't meet the terms of contract as an employee so they didn't proceed with employment.

Please don't allow false comparisons like this to colour your views.

I've posted before that I am all for blacks and black causes that help my race rise up, but that I hate black mentality.  I have been on the end of the sword of hatred from my own people and it breaks my heart when I see those with a different opinion be told they ""aren't black enough"" or they are ""so white"".

I have never really leaned to the right but for the context of her ad, she is right.  If things have just gotten worse there, maybe it's time for a change and fresh ideas.  Sadly for her, a majority of her own people will call her an Uncle Tom and dismiss her entirely.  It's sad that we have so little give in our community.   

I dislike my own community because I see such wasted potential.  I see stagnation.  I see crabs in a boiling pot trying to escape and pulling the ones about to escape back in.

The thought of anything Republican as being racist is engrained.   It doesnt matter if the idea is good.  Its cutting the nose to spite the face.

I know people hate the idea of a historically black college but as I grew I realized education is the only way out of the pot and lift up future generations from this.  It's a way to build up pride for ourselves that is obviously lacking.  Not saying we dont work hard but I do see, even with people in my own family, a lack of pride and responsibility. 

I was judged for not dating black men and marrying a southern redneck.  I was disrespectful to my race.  Anything different is frowned upon.  Skin too light?  Not black enough.  You use correct enunciation?  Too white.

Republican blacks have almost no clout to the general black community but, again I'm independent, they keep taking the gut punches and try to do what they see will help a people that has largely disowned them.  I have to give props to the balls they have.  It takes strength to go against the grain and champion what you think is right in the face of resistance. 

That's my 2 cents for what it's worth.  I used to work at an all black business and the hatred for me was amazing but I went with it to just get by without direct confrontation.   I'm glad there are those that can keep it going.",Cainayus,18,1597861641.0,False

You failed. 

Disproportionately low = not fair
Give me my plat.

It is not disproportionate considering all factors. The proportions are natural.

Disproportionate would imply that the proportions were being altered by some variable outside of the expected parameters. 

Its is DISPARATE. Not disproportionate. 

Support your claim that the proportions are being altered unnaturally, not simply that they exist. 

7 is proportionate considering all factors.

I was explaining why the numbers are disparate. Which is due to natural observable, not manipulated factors.

Meaning it is proportionate. 

If the world worked such that equal opportunity always produced equal outcome and that intelligence fairly separated itself among different skin colors at all times.

( 1 white genius for every 1 black and 1 asian etc.etc.)

Then the numbers are disproportionate.

However the world does not work that way and considering all factors. The black billionaire population is proportionate. To their overall pop, considering their length of accumulation, availability of new jobs or fields where there are no established monopolies, 
(Cant have a black soda billionaire if theres already a chinese one, because the chinese one will make sure of it, its called a monopoly.)

But then this article, which contains no context about the political affiliations of someone making a judgement that is inherently political in nature (and not to mention if he ever had actually examined Biden he'd be violating about fourteen federal laws including parts of HIPAA to make this statement) gets posted here like it's Gospel despite the representative quoted basing an entire campaign on his relationship to the current President, not previous administrations. Jackson is a hack. No serious doctor would ever assume being a personal physician qualified them to run the VA, and I don't think a single person here thinks otherwise. He's a nakedly partisan politician with an article headline being presented as truthful without proper context, and that is exactly the kind of article I usually see people complaining about in this sub.

Do you only want context for the information you feel you need to dispute?

REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF LIBERTY!

The facts are that today the Nazi party, white supremacists, Ku Klux Klan, whatever you want to call them support the same policies that racist Joe Biden supported when he was in the Congress, when racist Biden was in the Senate and when racist Biden was in the White House! 

These are the facts! 
1. It is not Donald Trump that worked with the KKK and white supremacists in the 70s to prevent black children from going to white schools it was racist Joe! 
2. It was not Donald Trump who wrote the 94 crime bill that put millions of black Americans in prison for minor crimes it was racist joe!  
3. It was not President Trump who while serving as vice president deported more than 5 million immigrants!  Millions more than Donald Trump will ever ever deport in 8 years.  Racist joe deported 5 MILLION immigrants. 

I have yet to hear you acknowledge any of the facts that Joe Biden has a lifetime of chronic racism AND ACTIVELY supported white supremacist policies and yet you keep deflecting by saying that white suprematist support Trump so Trump must be guilty. Dog whistle! 
President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs policies saw that Black people had the lowest unemployment in our nations history, Brought tens of millions of dollars to  communities of color and reformed criminal justice, and Created the first step act where Trump has made investments and convicted criminals getting out of jail so they can have a new life.

Masks still help stop people giving the virus to each other, and given that the only inconvienece they provide is giving your face a little warm hug means the pros outweigh the cons.

The vast vast majority of the elderly people who died with covid died from covid. Even if covid wasnt the only cause, it wiukd have been a contributor to most of the deaths.

The thing you don't understand is we can't simply stop covid, nor can we simply stop the flu. We can only severely lower the chances of death by vaccination and treatment.

Natural immunity has always been a thing. It's why vaccines for things like the flu (and even covid) are typically distributed to high risk individuals first. Natural immunity for an 80 year old, obese, diabetic woman would be far more dangerous than natural immunity for a 20 year old football player. 

Now, natural immunity is not always a valid option. For example, small pox or polio. These things are so deadly that natural immunity comes at too high a cost.

But, natural immunity for covid seems to be a valid option for most people. Research is continuing to show that most individuals maintain a good level of immunity up to atleast a year after infection and while it needs peer review, the Israel paper on natural immunity indicates that it provides better immunity than the vaccine.
