2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching üôÑ

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... ",1727014600.0,7713,986

1exsxlx,Watching the DNC speeches last night. Please read.,"
This is my husband. He is a Gulf War veteran. He worked 12 hours today as a mechanic (like he does every day). He came home, ate dinner, drank a beer, and helped me pack a few more boxes for our upcoming move out of this shitty apartment where we have lived for the last five years because housing is so freaking expensive where we live. (Obligatory fuck you to the greedy property management corps and Air BnBs who own goddamn everything around us). He is still wearing his dirty work uniform and is so tired that he hasn‚Äôt even showered yet because our work isn‚Äôt quite over for the day. He is taking a quick break to watch a few of the speeches before getting back to the task. He doesn‚Äôt complain though. No, he just does what he needs to do and then tomorrow he will wake up and start all over, all with kindness in his heart and a positive attitude. He is my rock. He is also tearing up watching Michelle and Barack Obama speaking last night. Those are happy tears. Tears of relief. Hope is such a powerful emotion. My husband the veteran doesn‚Äôt want Traitor Trump to ever get near the White House again and he is so tired of the GOP and their negativity, fascist tendencies, and deeply skewed version of ‚Äúpatriotism.‚Äù My man is a hard working patriot and is voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

1gjzm99,First Time Voter,"For the first time in my life, I was drawn out to vote. 

I have never had a political bone in my body. 

I was annoyingly indifferent about the entire American project. 

So, with a heavy heart, I found it no longer acceptable to be inactive. 

I felt compelled to vote not for anything but rather against so much.

I have watched Donald Trump flaunt his self-serving destruction of our nation's norms. Mutating good Americans into the type of people who denigrate the very essence of what it means to be an American.

He has corrupted so many fine and upstanding people. 

Folks I knew to be kind and good-hearted regurgitating some of the most vial talking points and excusing some of the most sick moral failures of the former president. 

To name a few that come to mind.

Trump had an affair 4 months after his wife gave birth. 

Trump was convicted in front of a jury of his peers that he had r*ped E. Jean Carroll according to the common definition of the word.

Trump plotted to steal the 2020 election by attempting to pressure Mike Pence under threat of violence into certifying Trump's false slate of electors. 

As the mob chanted ""hang Mike Pence,"" Trump tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done."" 

Trump believes that half the population should be considered ""the enemy within."" 

He has degraded prisoners of war, saying, ""I like people who weren't captured."" 

All of these have been either dismissed or praised by American ""Patriots."" 

His cult followers will defend all his unacceptable behavior by saying, ""It's all jokes"" or ""It's the liberal media."" 

Defenses that only further highlight how much he has melted the minds of these people.

It's clear that all these criticisms are not baseless attacks. They are part of an established pattern of behavior that has been validated time and time again by folks with wide-ranging relationships with Trump. 

From former staffers, government and military professionals, members of his cabinet, judges, family members, business partners, experts, and many others. 

Folks from each group all share the same resounding and clear message. 

It's the message that drove me to vote, and it's a message I would like to echo here.

Donald Trump is not fit to be the next president of the United States.",1730784590.0,2963,83

I voted for the ticket with Harris on it in the primary, I'll vote for the ticket with Harris on it for the election. No problem seen.

I know that the 'no one voted for Harris' argument isn't legitimate, it's just the other side of the aisle trying to invent a wedge issue to break down Democratic support. They're all pointless, bad faith arguments, this one just gets under my skin.

i **understand** the constant gaslighting is exhausting. 

i **understand** it's infuriating that his enablers make excuses for him.  

i **understand** it's heartbreaking when everyone around him ignores everything they see and hear and pretend nothing happened.   

i **understand** a new set of rules seems to be invented just for him, and him *only*.

i **understand** its triggering to keep being told you're ""overreacting"".

i **understand** how it feels to be told that *you're* the problem, and that *you* made him hurt you by not just letting him ""blow off steam""

i **understand** his enablers are just as terrified of him, and that's why they keep supporting him.  

i **understand** when the courts keep giving him another chance to come back and finish the job.  

i **understand** the constant feelings of impending doom everytime he's present

i **understand** feeling isolated and questioning yourself and wondering if everyone else is right when they say you're just ""being too sensitive"" and reduces everything he does into a ""joke"" that you ""misunderstood"" 

i **understand** never being able to hide from or avoid him.   

i **understand** losing friends and family because he keeps lying to them and you can't change their minds, even when you show them the receipts. 

i **understand** because i *survived* it.  

But America, all is **not lost** and you are **not** crazy. Everything you feel is valid. Everything you have experienced **really did happen to you**. you **will** come out of this stronger, happier and better. 

I know that seems impossible to even imagine right now. i know you feel lost and defeated, but i promise you are not alone. i know it's terrifying to think about and predict his reaction based on all the times you tried to get out of this relationship, but *you have to cut all ties with him*. you have to get him out of your house. you have to pile all his crap on the curb. you have to change the locks. you have to block all contact and refuse to listen to anyone who advocates for him. but, you **can** escape him.     

America, you **have to vote** and you **have to vote for Joe Biden**. that's the *only* way you **survive** this abusive relationship. **you're not a victim America, you're a survivor** never forget that.

1gm8orn,"No, 20 million Democrats did not just ‚Äúnot show up.‚Äù","I have been seeing this very misguided idea floating around this sub, so I‚Äôve decided to put it to rest by calculating the remaining vote and seeing how we can expect it to add up. I‚Äôm only calculating the substantial remaining vote, meaning I‚Äôm not doing it for states that are 99% reported, as that would take forever. I‚Äôll cluster those together in a lazy calculation at the end.

California ‚Äî 7,520,900 votes to be counted.

Assuming current splits hold up (though these votes may be more heavily in Harris‚Äôs favor):

Harris ‚Äî 4,332,038 Votes
Trump - 2,985,796 Votes

Oregon ‚Äî 257,107 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 257,107 votes
Trump ‚Äî 197,631 votes

Washington ‚Äî 509,070 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 297,296 votes
Trump ‚Äî 198,028 votes

Maryland ‚Äî 550,074 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 333,894 votes
Trump ‚Äî 201,877 votes

Arizona ‚Äî 825,835 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 384,839 votes
Trump ‚Äî 433,563 votes

Nevada ‚Äî 134,357 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 63,416 votes
Trump ‚Äî 68,522 votes

Now we will assume that every other state is collectively 99.5% reported, meaning ~715,567 votes remain. Since this is between both red and blue states, I‚Äôll just assume a 50/50 split on these votes.

This means **10,512,910** votes have yet to be reported.

This brings the final expected popular vote total to:

Harris ‚Äî 75,054,105 
Trump ‚Äî 77,813,469 

Overall: 152,867,574 votes

Compare to 2020:

Biden: 81,283,501
Trump: 74,223,975

Overall: 155,507,476

This means that 2024 turnout will be approximately **98.3%** of 2020 turnout.

So no, it is not true that we lost because ‚Äú20 million Democrats just couldn‚Äôt get off the couch.‚Äù Unfortunately, there was just an overall substantial rightward shift, which aligns with the incumbency disadvantage we‚Äôve been seeing globally due to inflation. ",1731034730.0,2617,520
