Why was it a good question, the Democrats just won the White House, The House and the Senate and on the first day of business the question is what are you doing to to advance the Republican agenda. 

The American people just said we do not want the Republican agenda, can you please help fix the mess the Republicans have been creating, we need help, can you please hold the Republicans accountable for the mess they have created with the Trump Presidency.

It was a very good answer, but it was a terribly bias question and Chris Hayes should have raised the question that after all the one sided BS the Republicans have been doing the past several decades why on earth the Democrats should be doing anything other than their agenda, and after Trump incited an attempted insurrection, after endless political games the Republicans have been guilty off, putting party over the country. 

To top it all off McConnell is already threatening to endlessly use the filibuster to get his way, wanting to put off the trial against Trump, and will not even for sure say if he will vote to convict. It is clear the Republican position is the exact same as under Obama, block everything they can, deny all their wrongdoings, and hope that next election cycle is more favorable to them so they can yet again push thru endless tax cuts, crush the middle class and ignore the people in this country who need the most help.

What the Biden administration needs to do is bring back the FDR style fireside chats and point by point destroy the Republican position on every single issue, use the position of the White House to argue the case, the media can not be trusted to educate the people, so do it directly.

The only reason the Republican agenda has any sway at the ballot box is due to the uneducated masses voting against their interests, time and time again.",RogueAOV,1,1611357065.0,False

I was a republican myself and voted for McCain and almost voted for Romney in 2012 and very late in the game changed to the Obama train.

I think we will learn from this.

""But my own experience suggests such resistance works best if it‚Äôs targeted well. It‚Äôs largely ineffective for protesters to focus their energy on the government‚Äôs top decision-makers, such as the president and his political appointees. On most issues, these people have made up their minds. Protest won‚Äôt sway them, and may in fact tempt their antidemocratic instincts. But virtually every government policy must be developed and implemented by people far below those appointees. These people ‚Äî who swear an independent oath to protect the Constitution ‚Äî can be affected by public influence, and as public servants, should be. Activism can help them understand issues, and empower them to speak up against illegal or unjust policies. That‚Äôs true, even as Trump tries to purge the federal government of anyone who won‚Äôt be completely loyal to him.""",Lebarican22,1,1739967952.0,False

Frankly, this is whining. The House has ""Power of the Purse"", the Executive only signs approval. But they are letting Trump use it as blackmail and 'DOGE' do whatever they want. And the response is paddles at the Joint Session, tweets and media interviews complaining... Whining. 

These actions and stated planned actions are Unconstitutional... So there needs to be a *fight* back. Bring in the Third Branch, at he very least, test how 'originalist' some of those Justices are. Drop Bill after Bill, not to say you are upset with Trump, but to reign in what he is doing.... They will likely fail, but you put Repugs on record to use in 2026 midterms to help win back control.

So, 6 to 12 million on the streets means 42 to 84 million adult voters that oppose the Trump regime. If the USA was a true Republic (representative democracy) with proportionally elected representatives, then Trump would be soon gone. But we do not live in a true Republic. Trump has prepared for resistance to his rule. Not only has he a police force that is prepared to attack Americans (ICE and othe DHS agents), he has signe and executive order, putting the National Gurard of all states on notice that they can be called up to defend his policies - even illegal policies.  In California, he has initiated an experiment to make his defense real with the nationalization ot the guard in California and the assignment of active duty Marines to protect his policies.    
At 77 I have seen the National Guard called out many times to stop street demonstrations and local rebellions. The violence launched in those actions was never good with the killing of many Americans by other Americans. My clearest memory of such an action was the murder by the Ohio National Guard of four students at Kent State University  on the 4th of May 1970.

6qwrmn,dl1zyms,"> On April 20, a month before the story ran, Butowsky and Wheeler ‚Äî the investor and the investigator ‚Äî met at the White House with then-press secretary Sean Spicer to brief him on what they were uncovering.

It seems like if Wheeler--the guy who was misquoted and is now suing about it--was present at the meeting, it probably doesn't make sense to conclude that the meeting shows White House collusion in the lie. This could have gone down like:

Spicer: Hey, long time no see. What're you up to?

Butowsky: we're looking into who murdered Seth Ritch

Spicer:  hoo boy, you catch 'em yet?

Wheeler: nope 

Spicer:  dang. Well, how's things otherwise?  You see that sports game the other day?

He breaks it down and says there are really 2 economies, the bottom 60% and the top 40%.

YOU MADE THIS HAPPEN. You support a violent felon who has literally made political violence the hallmark of BOTH of his failed administrations. Today Americans all over this country are in the streets protesting the illegal political violence that he is perpetrating against Americans and other people from all over the world RIGHT NOW. 

Today, your colleague was murdered --along with her spouse and her dog-- because YOU WERE SILENT. YOU WERE SILENT EVERY DAY while for the last six months Donald Trump used his position to HURT PEOPLE. He stole money from the poorest people in the world because of ""waste"", while today he is unilaterally spending MILLIONS OF OUR TAX DOLLARS on a military parade to honor him on his birthday - a DRAFT DODGER who stole money from donations for service members and first responders via his fraudulent charities, who publicly and volubly denounces and disrespects OUR armed service members and Gold Star Families. He is also spending untold millions on the illegal deployment of military forces to peaceful protests in Los Angeles and around the country - using the armed forces as his personal thug force and mischaracterizing these protests in order to ratchet up terror and LEGITIMIZE USING FORCE AGAINST AMERICANS.

YOUR SILENCE SUPPORTS THIS VIOLENT MAN. 

YOU WERE SILENT while he commanded ICE agents to abduct students, farm workers, laborers, members of communities, while he lied about their criminal status and shipped them to horrific foreign jails without due process. 

YOU WERE SILENT while families were torn apart and children were put in cages. 

YOU WERE SILENT while border agents used whips and horses to hurt people looking for sanctuary- parents, elderly people, small children.

YOU WERE SILENT while regular Americans in their own city were detained and assaulted by illegally deployed service members. 

YOU WERE SILENT while a sitting SENATOR was ASSAULTED by Kristi Noem's security detail for asking a question, and YOU WERE SILENT while they lied about his behavior: he was escorted into the briefing, he announced himself and his question, and he was simply DOING HIS JOB, but he was assaulted, detained, removed. And YOU REMAINED SILENT.

YOU WERE SILENT while other lawmakers were arrested and indicted for doing their legally- appointed jobs at a detention center, working to protect the people they swore an oath to serve. And YOU REMAINED SILENT.

YOU WERE SILENT when Trump pardoned HUNDREDS OF VIOLENT INSURRECTIONISTS - *people whose actions on January 6 literally threatened your lives* with VIOLENCE, people who VIOLENTLY *attacked and assaulted Capitol Police* as they struggled to protect YOU. People died because that day Trump whipped a crowd of his followers into a VIOLENT frenzy. AND YOU WERE SILENT. *How is that ""Back the Blue""?*

YOU WERE SILENT at his rallies A DECADE AGO where he ENCOURAGED his followers to VIOLENTLY ASSAULT people. 

Donald Trump has been VIOLENT since Day 1. 

He continues to foment and weaponize political animus, it is destroying our Democracy, and the entire world knows it.

*And only now do you denounce political violence?*

Then you had DAMN WELL BETTER DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

Otherwise, your empty words and flaccid inaction will prove your complicity, your cynicism, your glaring incompetence, and your absolute unfitness to participate in our political system.

If you are truly against political violence, NOW IS THE TIME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Stand up. Speak out. Use the momentum of this day to truly be a leader. STOP BEING SO AFRAID OF HIM AND STAND UP FOR WHAT YOU -AND THE REST OF US- KNOW IS RIGHT.

1gz6gmj,lzcits3,"You don‚Äôt seem to understand the process of investigation! The beginning of the investigation actually started before Trump left office.  The investigation though requires lots and lots and lots of interviews. Over 600 interviews of which notes have to be taken and then later transcribed and then printed out. Questions need to be typed out from those notes to ask other people and so on. In addition to that they have to choreograph everyone‚Äôs lives and schedules to bring them in for questioning.  The laws need to be researched to figure out which laws were broken and which laws have evidence to back up that they were broken.  It literally took over two years to do all of that.  traitor tRUMP knows this and that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt care what laws he broke because he knew that he could weasel out of them. What you should be angry about is that the DOJ has a policy, not a law but a policy, that they don‚Äôt prosecute asitting President. Which then implies that the president is indeed above the law, because they won‚Äôt prosecute a sitting president.  It‚Äôs staggering to know that the DOJ has this policy and that they don‚Äôt override it when they have the ability to do that.  Remember, it‚Äôs not a law. It is just their policy!!  Much like Sam‚Äôs club has a policy to see your member ID card before you enter the building, but you can go to the Eatery, in the same building, even if you are not a member!

1gz6gmj,lz0yz9c,"You will see a picture of him when you look up ""ineffectual"" in the dictionary.  That will be his legacy.

Before he became attorney general, he was the virtuous judge who was snubbed the the grubby Mitch McConnell.  So he had some prestige and political capital going into this.  And it was squandered by four years of dithering and frittering.

We got the worst of both worlds.  Garland sat on his hands and didn't want to go after Trump or his cronies.  This was not because of some misguided commitment to ""principle"" or ""rule of law,"" because Garland had the law and evidence he needed to go after Trump long long ago.  Garland just did not want to look ""provocative"" or ""controversial"" by prosecuting Trump.  Garland and politicians like him think that holding an ex-president accountable is just too ""controversial,"" even when that ex-president is guilty as sin and you have the evidence to prove it.  He thinks the way an attorney general proves he is ""serious"" is by shrinking away from anything that might anger the Republicans.  They think the respectable thing to do with a criminal president is to let him get away with it and hope he goes away.  Trump did not go away.  

Garland was a failure at being effective, and at being principled.  In Garland's mind, he thinks all that matters is that some hypothetical jury of ""respectable"" or ""serious"" or ""moderate"" people never thought Merrick Garland was being ""controversial.""

It's like Elon wouldn't surprise me if this is just for the memes,I mean think about it what's funnier then meme guru Elon giving financial advice to a ""republican"" and that said ""Republican"" making the white house a literal joke ... I still remember the speeches of Trump endorsing Hilary Clinton.... And telling people to vote for her.....¬†


It is just sad how the country has devolved in to this....¬†


The solution to the immigration problem is reform.....¬†
Make one visa , with the only cap being can only work low skills jobs. So someone want to come here on vacation and stay, fine ..... Or work or go to school and get a job out of school great, you can work low skills work ... This would remove the need for a cap on h1bs, and have the companies be the ones to prove there isn't a American qualified to do the job, and make sure they are offer the correct wages for the job as well..... And drop the price of visa to 50 dollars, my great grandfather came here in 1919 and paid four dollars to be a national..... Then add a non citizen tax 3% would if my math is right should more then cover any missing fees we would of gotten .... Then have their drivers license connected to their visas, so like breaking the law would suspend the visa .... And a police officer would know when they scan the thing the visa isn't valid.... And boom 85% of the immigrantion issue is solved...,. They are already here in our system and the country works, the clog is red tape and paperwork..... In 1975 a family of four with one person working would take one year to save up, that same family now a day would have to save for 13 years..... To just have the money and we keep increasing the prices..... Add a tax and give them an optional increase so if they want 5 % instead and have that money go to the others in the visa program and off set the burden on the system ....¬†


We could have a few waiver for refugees , they still have to pass a background check, make a non citizen birth certificate and when that child turns 18 give them a visa, with the option to apply for citizenship..... And fix the machine.... It is clearly broken from the beginning..... I speak English and can read and even I get confused on what an immigrant would need to do.... No one should need a lawyer to get a piece of paper to come here ...¬†


Then Suddenly we don't have people under paying them because labor laws would apply to them..... And we could even add a tax on companies that hire imgrants over us citizens to try to offer set the low skills jobs they do....¬† Or add a tax on high skill jobs....¬† And we just made it legal for about 9 million illegals to suddenly be legal, and made the system self funded and then the ones who do cross the border, throw the book at them because those would be the ""bad"" ones... We also have the room because they fill jobs no one here wants to do in the first place..... Or they are taking jobs we would do because labor laws don't apply to them.....¬†

Aside from the numerous tariffs they've had on us for many years, a trade war would reset and expand our economy. Not destroy it.

Elon has been a US citizen since 2002, so under the US Constitution's Appointments Clause, Elon being appointed by Trump is 100% legal.

USAID is a govt agency that violated Trump's orders and was caught money laundering, so Elon (with the clearance and authority given to him) audited them like he was appointed to do. There was nothing illegal about that.

Using the FOIA (Freedom of Information Act), all of us as US citizens have a legal right to request any and all fund related documents of such govt agencies whenever we see fit. The only difference with Elon's clearance is that he doesn't have to ask.

For point 4, you mean pause spending to audit them like we should be doing to clean up the billions upon billions of fraud?

(see 13:15 here  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8SHK7idxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8SHK7idxs) )  There is also the result that Trump flipped 88 counties from blue to red, while Harris flipped... zero. That has not happened since FDR, and this was a highly contested race. Not even Reagan did that (34:24 in the linked video).

* Kelly, Shapiro, Walz are in top tier for vice presidential run
* Presumed Democratic nominee expected to make pick by Aug. 7

Vice President¬†Kamala Harris¬†is zeroing in on a group of potential running mates, as she faces a two-week dash to make the biggest decision of her nascent presidential bid.

Harris is considering a¬†[wide range](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-22/kamala-harris-likely-to-pick-from-rising-stars-for-running-mate)¬†of vice presidential candidates from the Democratic Party‚Äôs bench, though **people familiar with the process say a short list has emerged** including three elected officials with nationwide appeal: Arizona Senator¬†Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor¬†Josh Shapiro¬†and Minnesota Governor¬†Tim Walz.

Upon a high-level re-evaluation of the vice presidential candidates, here‚Äôs a refined analysis of Mark Kelly, Josh Shapiro, and Tim Walz:

**Mark Kelly**:

* **Pros**: Senator Kelly‚Äôs career as an astronaut and military officer gives him a compelling narrative in defense and space policy. His partnership with Gabrielle Giffords enhances his political stature.
* **Cons**: Questions about his depth of legislative experience may arise due to his short tenure in the Senate.

**Josh Shapiro**:

* **Pros**: Governor Shapiro‚Äôs leadership in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state, offers significant electoral value. His previous role as attorney general demonstrates his legal acumen.
* **Cons**: Shapiro may need to broaden his policy scope to resonate with the national electorate.

**Tim Walz**:

* **Pros**: Governor Walz‚Äôs connection with rural voters could extend Democratic reach. His response to the George Floyd incident showed his ability to handle national crises.
* **Cons**: Walz‚Äôs challenge lies in amplifying his national presence to match the visibility of other potential candidates.

In conclusion, each candidate brings valuable strengths to the table: Kelly with his unique background and centrist policies, Shapiro with his legal expertise and swing state leverage, and Walz with his crisis management skills and rural appeal. The best choice for a vice presidential candidate would be one that complements the presidential nominee‚Äôs platform and addresses the campaign‚Äôs strategic needs while resonating with the electorate‚Äôs priorities. Each candidate brings a distinct set of strengths that align with various strategic goals. Kelly offers a narrative of service and resilience, Shapiro provides legal acumen and swing state appeal, and Walz connects with rural voters and champions education. The optimal choice would balance these strengths with the campaign‚Äôs overarching objectives and the presidential candidate‚Äôs profile.",Strict-Marsupial6141,1,1722259219.0,False
1e91m7b,lfh9mck,"¬†In the complex world of foreign policy and security, teamwork is not just beneficial, it‚Äôs imperative. Leaders like Tim Walz and Mark Kelly would work within a framework of collaboration, drawing on the expertise and advice of a dedicated team of professionals. This collective approach allows for a well-rounded and strategic handling of international affairs, ensuring that decisions are made with consideration of the broadest possible range of insights and expertise. It‚Äôs the strength of the team that often determines the success of policy implementation and diplomatic endeavors.

**Tim Walz**¬†has shown his leadership skills through his governance of Minnesota, particularly in times of crisis, and his military service. His experience in education also suggests an ability to communicate complex ideas effectively, a valuable trait in diplomacy.

**Mark Kelly**, on the other hand, has a background that includes not only military service but also time spent in one of the most collaborative international environments‚Äîspace exploration. His senatorial role has provided him with direct experience in policymaking and national security issues.

¬†Leaders like Tim Walz and Mark Kelly would not be making decisions in isolation; they would be part of a larger team that includes advisors, experts, and other government officials. This collaborative approach ensures that a range of perspectives and expertise are considered, leading to more informed and effective decision-making. It‚Äôs the synergy of the team that often leads to the best outcomes in complex international matters.

Let's compare with Cooper and Beshear:

When comparing the foreign policy experience of Tim Walz and Mark Kelly to Andy Beshear and Roy Cooper, it‚Äôs important to consider the different backgrounds and roles each has held:

* [**Andy Beshear** has been the Governor of Kentucky since 2019 and previously served as the state‚Äôs Attorney General from 2016 to 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear)[^(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear). [While his roles have primarily focused on state-level governance, his ability to win elections in a predominantly Republican state and his handling of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters have been noted as strengths that could translate well into national and international politics](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/22/why-kentucky-gov-andy-beshear-is-and-isnt-the-best-vp-nominee/74473319007/)[^(2)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/22/why-kentucky-gov-andy-beshear-is-and-isnt-the-best-vp-nominee/74473319007/).
* **Roy Cooper** has served as the Governor of North Carolina since 2017, after serving as the state‚Äôs Attorney General for 16 years and in the North Carolina General Assembly. [His tenure as Attorney General and his experience with legal and regulatory matters give him a strong background in domestic policy, which is a crucial component of understanding broader foreign policy issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper)[^(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper).

While Tim Walz and Mark Kelly may have more direct experience with international matters due to their military backgrounds and, in Kelly‚Äôs case, his work as a U.S. Senator, Beshear and Cooper bring their own sets of experiences that could be valuable in a vice-presidential role. Their successes in governance, crisis management, and legal affairs provide a solid foundation for understanding the complexities of foreign policy and security challenges.

In the end, **the effectiveness in foreign policy often comes down to the ability to work well within a team, leverage diverse experiences, and make informed decisions.** 

All four individuals have demonstrated leadership qualities that could be beneficial when dealing with international affairs, each bringing a unique perspective to the table.",Strict-Marsupial6141,1,1722256903.0,False

""I've got a few gripes with Pete Buttigieg, but she'd be insane not to choose him as a VP.

The guy is antimatter JD Vance; they're both from Midwest red states, both fairly young and relatively new to national politics, both veterans who went to Ivy League schools and spent time in finance, but Pete's politics are reasonable, rational, and not based on hatred. He's also a phenomenal communicator; he went to a Town Hall meeting hosted by Fox News in New Hampshire, advocated for the dissolution of the Electoral College and legal late-term abortions, and got a¬†*standing ovation.*¬†He would wipe the debate stage with Vance!

He also checks several demo boxes that Harris doesn't; he's White, he's male, he's gay, and he has young children (and as sexist as that criticism of her is, it's likely to resonate with some independent voters). He speaks like seven languages, several fluently, which would be¬†*invaluable*¬†on the world stage and on diplomatic visits. He's also got national name recognition and acclaim from the 2020 primary; people - even Republicans -¬†*love*¬†him!

He's already got experience working within a presidential administration, and in fact, they've already worked together, so they probably know each other very well. Also as a consequence of that, he's already been vetted, so that saves time on an already hurried process.

Perhaps no one in the history of our nation, probably in the history of humanity and the world, has ever done so much to change the world and make a massive impact upon humanity as that of former president Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter represented the best of what humanity had to offer and showed us all how to be champions of public service. He served his country in the military with such Noble dignity until he had to leave due to the death of his father. He sacrificed his military career to work on the peanut farm that his parents owed in Georgia, from there, he used his voice to speak up for the voiceless in political work first being governor of georgia, and then for the highest office in the nation, president. Although he served one term, his cause and his actions were just and noble, using dialogue as a means to promote the true everlasting aspect of peace throughout the world. The world is a much better place because of this champion of change. He started the movement of the habitat for humanity cause to help bring home for those who could not afford a home and to have a better life all around the world.

During his speech in the 1970s, he told us that we were facing ""a crisis of consciousness"" at that time, we were facing several crises on different fronts. Today, those words have never been so more poignant than now because of what we are about to deal with. But we are a resilient Nation because of people like Jimmy Carter who believed in Hope.

In taking him to his rest to be reunited with Rosalyn, his beloved of nearly 80 years, and laying him to his eternal rest among the Stars and among the angels, our country is a better place today because of him and for this, we especially wish to extend the highest praise and gratitude to him, his family, and the people of plains Georgia and other places of his life that made him the man who he is. Yes, we will grieve, this is a time of great sadness, but also a time of great spiritual celebration, for today is his graduation from his earthly realm, and now has received his wings.

The 2024 Trump vs. US SCOTUS ruled that a POTUS is immune from prosecution for actions within the scope of official duties but no immunity for unofficial acts. The 2024 ruling did not overturn the 2020 ruling.  This has to do with official duties while in office.

In other words, the Supreme Court ruled that a POTUS has protection from official acts but not from personal actions.  Obstruction of justice and turning the White House into a Tesla show room, among others,  fall into personal actions, but of course a POTUS can say that the personal action was in line with official duty. The 2024 ruling really said that it is up to the courts to decide.

Justice Alito is the only current Supreme Court Justice to never side with the liberal bloc afaik, which leaves 5 other Justices to potentially rule against Trump, which from a statistical standpoint, are pretty good odds.",crucial_geek,1,1742398920.0,False

1f1s1yt,lk2wrg2,"I've written this a few times but here's my take on why Trump won in 2016 and why he will never win again. 

1) Hillary's strategy was one of the worst in modern politics. Her campaign focused way too much on Florida and outright ignored the midwest, taking entire swaths of the country for granted.

2) Also there was a lot of bad will towards Hillary. The far left was mad that she was anointed and that the DNC essentially cut the legs out from Bernie. Meanwhile the right had been told nonstop for the last few years that she was satan incarnate. Benghazi and all that shit was on repeat on FOX News 24/7. Also if she would have won that means 24 out of the last 32 years of US history would have been a Clinton or a Bush in charge. Are only 2 fucking families allowed to run this country?

3) But even with all that she was predicted to win handedly. So a lot of people were like ""Eh, she's gonna win, might as well write in Bernie ... or vote for Jill Stein"". I personally know more than a few people that just assumed she would win and tried to vote 3rd party. They thought it was a layup to the point that they were like let's try to put a little effort to changing the system for next time. I mean everyone hates the 2 party system.

4) And on top of everything, Trump was coming in out of nowhere. He was funny. He was loud. And he wasn't a politician. He was going up against a career politician and he was like ""I'm not like them, I don't know what I'm doing, I'm an outsider"". And that message resonated. 

5) Plus we were coming off 8 relatively scandal-free years (at least compared to the last few presidents) with Obama. Things were going well, we'd gotten through the housing crisis (and hadn't hit the new housing crisis yet). There was an air of complacency so more than a few folks said ""fuck it, let the dog drive and lets see what happens"".

But that was his one chance. It was lightning in a bottle. 

He will never be able to play that ""outsider"" card again because we know he's not an outsider. He didn't drain the swamp, he tried to rule the swamp like a king. He's sell the copper pipes out of the white house if he could. We've seen over 8 years he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing or how to approach being a president. He doesn't know how to lead. He doesn't even know how to read. He's a mess with a very vocal very small fanbase. It's why practically every down ballot person he endorses loses. Because he's lost all clout and relevancy.

Soon, for emergency care all the residents will have to drive to say North Platte about one hour away from Curtis.  Thus, even if you have health care and you have a heart attack, the emergency care you need could be more the one hour further away than the local hospital, putting you life in greater danger.

The highest law of the land.
The framework of freedom.
The last line of defense between people and tyranny.
It belongs to every American. Not to presidents. Not to parties. Not to billionaires.

Donald Trump spit on it.

Article I - Separation of Powers:
Trump uses the DOJ as a personal hit squad.
Shields himself. Hunts enemies. Pardons criminals who serve him.

Article II - Executive Accountability:
Trump claims ""total immunity.""
Demands unchecked power.
Dreams of jailing critics. Dreams of ruling by decree.

Article III - Judicial Independence:
Trump stacks courts with loyalists.
Undermines judges. Smears juries.
Declares courts ""rigged"" if they dare to say he is guilty.

First Amendment - Free Speech, Press, Assembly:
Trump demonizes the free press.
Calls journalists ""enemies of the people.""
Encourages violence. Threatens to shut media down.

Fourteenth Amendment - Equal Protection:
Trump targets immigrants, minorities, LGBTQ citizens.
Separates families. Bans religious groups.
Praises white supremacists.

Voting Rights - Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-fourth Amendments:
Trump lies about elections.
Throws out ballots.
Tries to nullify democracy if he loses.

Every word Trump speaks is a defilement of the Constitution.

And it‚Äôs not just him.
It‚Äôs every last rotting loyalist still breathing government air:

Mark Meadows
Jim Jordan
Marjorie Taylor Greene
Ron DeSantis
Josh Hawley
Lindsey Graham
Brett Kavanaugh
Amy Coney Barrett
And the hundreds more who traded America for a seat at Trump‚Äôs table.

They have sworn allegiance to one man.
Not the law. Not the Constitution. Not the People.

This is sedition.

This is betrayal.

This is how republics fall.

What must be done? NOW?

1. Call, email, fax, and show up at every elected official‚Äôs office.
Demand they disqualify Trump and his loyalists under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Demand impeachment.
Demand removal.

2. Name and archive every official, judge, officer who swore loyalty to Trump.
Permanent records.
Permanent consequences.
No forgiveness without public repentance.

3. Organize mass protests.
Not one day.
Every day.
Every city.
Make tyranny impossible to ignore.

4. Boycott every company funding MAGA candidates.
Publicize their names.
Crush their profits.
Force them to choose democracy or dictatorship.

5. Create citizen watchdog groups.
Show up.
Demand answers.
Shut down corruption before it breeds again.

6. Pressure allies abroad to sanction Trump‚Äôs regime if he seizes power.
Force international isolation until democracy is restored.

7. Refuse normalization.
Never say ‚Äúboth sides.‚Äù
Never call this ""politics.""
It‚Äôs sedition.
It‚Äôs treason.
Call it what it is.

8. Force televised accountability hearings.
Every crime.
Every betrayal.
Drag it into the light.

9. Demand constitutional reforms.
Presidential immunity must end.
Insurrection clauses must have teeth.
Voting rights must be bulletproof.

10. Swear this cancer will never grow again.

This is the line.

Right here.
Right now.

Trump is not just a bad president.
He is a clear and present danger to the Republic.
Every loyalist helping him is an enemy of democracy.

This is not politics.
This is survival.

Choose your side.

Choose it now.

Biden is a very old president willing to take one for the team and be the guy that actually withdraws from Afghanistan. Nobody else wanted to try because they wanted to be re-elected and I doubt Biden wants to be the prez at age 86. 

Conservatives have been starving for red meat since Jan 20th and are already free basing dreams of '22 and' 24 BECAUSE they NEED something to change. So now FOX has to somehow turn a positive into a negative by using really good messaging and images of people at the airport or falling from the planes. FOX is using very obvious tactics but in a pounding wave approach that we don't usually see. Notice how NONE of the FOX clips about the Afghan exit has comments enabled on yt? That's partially the GOPs way of saying to their audience ""everybody zip-it! Let us show you what the approach and messaging will be.""


The people left behind is a separate issue that Biden will not be immune from but it begs the question ""who in their right mind is living in Afghanistan months after usa declares exit?!"" If you helped Americans in the battle for Tora Bora you should have been extracted to America literally a decade ago and if you're a contractor you should absolutely NOT wait until the last min you should have been gone months ago and if you're living there as a resident in the 2nd most dangerous shthole country in the world I don't know what to tell you

People that are fake mad right now won't remember why 1.5 yrs from now. By late 2022, the floating fact about ""the Afghan exit"" will be the minimal casualties and that FOX News said they were mad at democrats and that Trump would have done it better blah blah blah. I'm not pretending the whole situation is rainbows and butterflies but we exited with no deaths and history will be kind to Biden for that, you'll see.

I voted a blue ticket knowing that, if the worst (which has) happened, we would have a blue line of defense. That line of defense has pretty much evaporated, save for third party orgs who are doing Congressional work and more.

I strongly believe in protecting our Constitution and the principles it represents. While freedom of speech is a fundamental right, there's a line that shouldn't be crossed when it comes to undermining the very foundation of our nation.

It's concerning to hear some Republicans claim our country is failing. If they truly believe America is in such dire straits, perhaps they should consider relocating. However, it's important to note that criticizing our country or its leaders is a protected right and part of a healthy democracy.

The real issue arises when individuals begin to assault our Constitution. At that point, we need to consider serious consequences, potentially including imprisonment, to protect our democratic institutions.

Instead of attempting to replace our Constitution with the whims of a former game show host, we should focus on:

1. Enriching our country
2. Strengthening the principles that have made us a global leader
3. Finding ways to improve our nation within the framework of our existing constitutional system

What happened in that room was an act of groveling submission to authoritarianism, a moment in which the so-called ""leaders"" of America turned their backs on the very values this nation was founded upon. Trump and Vance did not speak to Zelensky as allies, nor as partners in democracy. They spoke to him as cowards who have already surrendered.

Trump and Vance are not America. They are a disgrace to America. They are a stain on the very soul of this nation. They are the embodiment of every failure, every betrayal, every moment of weakness that has allowed tyranny to flourish. They are not defenders of democracy; they are its executioners.

And yet, while Trump cowers before dictators and sells out his own allies, while Vance parrots the talking points of autocrats, while American democracy fights through its darkest hour, there is one man who stands where they have fallen.

Zelensky.

Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine, is the true leader of the free world.

Not Trump. Not Vance. Not the billionaires. Not the cowards and appeasers who think that democracy can be traded away for temporary comfort.

Zelensky is the last man standing in the face of authoritarian aggression.

He does not have billions of dollars in stolen wealth propping him up. He does not have a state-controlled propaganda machine rewriting history on his behalf. What he has is courage. What he has is a spine. What he has is a commitment to democracy that puts every so-called leader in the West to shame.

Trump and Vance? They are frauds. They are weaklings who would rather kneel before tyrants than fight for what is right.

1m6b5si,n4kl99j,"I hate to be that guy because I agree with the sentiment, but from an accounting perspective, a ‚Äúcost‚Äù and a ‚Äúloss‚Äù are two different things.

You can say that the losses of the USPS are a cost to the taxpayer that we collectively want to have, despite the negative connotation, but it‚Äôs still a loss.

To explain, I‚Äôll remind you what a P&L statement is. The P&L (profit and loss) statement is one of the three basic accounting statements (the other two being the cashflow statement and the balance sheet). 

The P&L measures whether you had profit or loss on a given period (month, quarter, year). 

The top line on the statement (the first one that goes at the very top) is ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù, that is the total amount of money you charged for your goods and services.

The next lines are usually costs that you subtract from revenue, things like cost of goods sold (or cost of service delivery), labor costs, operational expenses, overhead, interest payments, pensions, taxes, and others‚Ä¶

You subtract your costs to the revenue, and you get your profit. If your profit is negative, it‚Äôs called a ‚Äúloss‚Äù.

The P&L is important because it allows you to identify inefficiencies that can make your business better. I still want the USPS to improve. And indeed, in the past, the USPS has presented plans to make itself profitable through efficiency gains that would‚Äôve been politically unpopular, but would not have affected service quality or delivery (mainly, closing branches and instead opening small kiosks in places like malls or grocery stores, increased automation, and centralizing operations). I think exploring these ideas deserve a lot of merit.

So, it‚Äôs ok to say that the USPS has a loss. As long as we understand that this loss is a taxpayer cost that we happily absorb to get the services USPS provide in the way they provide it; that it‚Äôs something we want as a society. What it‚Äôs not ok is confusing a loss and a cost because we don‚Äôt want to deal with reality. One thing is to accept USPS‚Äôs losses as ‚Äúgood things‚Äù and another is to just negate their existence. It‚Äôs obvious that opportunities for efficiencies exist, but they‚Äôre not politically desirable, so we accept the loss as a government cost.",PM_ME_YOUR_THESES,0,1753208966.0,False

>**Head of Trump‚Äôs Immigration Plans Met Proud Boys Associate About Deportations**

>The head of President Donald Trump‚Äôs immigration policy, Tom Homan, appears to have met with an associate of the Proud Boys on at least four separate occasions. At least one of these instances was a private meeting held in Chicago after the 2024 presidential election to talk about deportations, according to social media posts reviewed by Hatewatch.

>Homan, who leads the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts to curb immigration at the border as well as deport migrants across the U.S., met with Terry Newsome in Chicago and Washington, D.C., according to posts on Facebook and X, formerly Twitter.

>...

>As Homan begins to implement the Trump administration‚Äôs deportation plans, his association with such figures as Newsome, who openly collaborates with violent groups like the Proud Boys, is particularly dangerous for targeted communities. In videos Newsome has posted to his social media accounts, he has harassed people outside migrant shelters hoping to create viral moments for his podcast. In an Aug. 4, 2024, post to Facebook, Newsome referred to these as his ‚ÄúVenezuelan gang member hunting trips.‚Äù

>...

>Newsome has met with Tom Homan at least twice since December 2024 to talk about deportations in Chicago. Homan was also a guest on Newsome‚Äôs podcast Oct. 2, 2024. In June 2024, Newsome hosted a panel discussion on immigration that featured Homan. Initially appointed to a top spot in ICE by former President Barack Obama, Homan became acting director of the agency in the first Trump administration. Homan is now overseeing the second Trump administration‚Äôs immigration policy as the so-called border czar.

>Homan joined a meeting in Chicago on Dec. 9, 2024, that was hosted by supportive Republican and Democratic politicians, as well as conservative activists. In his remarks to the group, Homan said that President Trump‚Äôs deportation plan would start in Chicago. He also warned that Chicago‚Äôs mayor, Brandon Johnson, would be prosecuted if he impeded the administration‚Äôs deportation plans. Chicago is one of several Democrat-led cities that have passed ordinances to protect migrants from ICE. Commonly referred to as sanctuary cities, they have ordinances prohibiting local police departments from assisting ICE. These ordinances also provide other protections to migrants.

My 83 year old mum used a postal vote and i walked half a mile to a polling station, queued for 30 seconds at around 4.30pm then walked back home again. I hope the Labour Party appreciates this. (Our equivalent of Democrats).

There were representatives from both sides overseeing the count, in some cases recounts were done because of incredibly small majorities. (15 and 18 votes in the narrowest victories).

In the end, everything was sorted and about a day later we had a new government and the departing Prime Minister made his traditional speech conceeding defeat.

Despite what newly minted Republican Vice-presidential candidate J D Vance thinks, the UK is not an Islamist state, we don't have sharia law, but we do have a Mayor of London called Sadiq Khan who does an excellent job of running one of the great capitals of the world despite only getting a tiny 7% of it's revenue. (New York gets 50%). He gets an awful lot of hate directed his way from the right-wing, Indian nationalists and Islamaphobic trolls all over the world.
President Trump tried to ignite a twitter feud with Sadiq Khan without success during a state visit. 

Imagine the Leader of The Free World indulging in childish and petty behaviour as a guest in a friendly nation.
We liked the Obamas when they visited, the late Queen reputedly got on very well with them both personally and as visiting dignitaries, and they are always welcome here.

I would support the chopping off of the hands of motorcycle thieves as i have had two stolen, but i doubt very much such laws would get through.
They might if the Conservative Party ever got reelected under Suella Braverman, who tends to be the UK equivalent of MAGA.

We didn't have the options we would have liked to have voted for, but you should turn out and vote anyway because this might well prove to be the last truly free election that America ever has, Project 2025, the religious right and the Heritage foundation are all backing Donald Trump and will quite probably turn the USA into a religious theocracy with most of the checks and balances on your government removed and power concentrated in the Executive Branch.

This election should show you just how many ppl have two brain cells to rub together to say hey, this is really important, I need to vote Kamala. The other folks fall into the racist, fascist, cult category (which shows us there‚Äôs a lot) and the single cells helped them. 
And in typical (legacy) Dem fashion, the elites have conceded and handed Trump the reins with applause and congratulations. Where‚Äôs the recount? The blabber mouth has already said Musk knows about voting machines and ‚Äòstole‚Äô various state wins!

You'll see lots of warnings about complacency. But remember, complacency doesn't just mean being overconfident and not voting. Complacency means not continuing to do everything you can. We can't ease up on donations, volunteering, or engaging with others. We have to continue to act as if the election is a toss up - because it very well could be! In politics being ahead doesn't mean you win. Clinton was ahead in virtually every poll in the run-up to 2016.  

There's no such thing as doing too much. If we're very lucky and we continue to fight tooth and nail we might absolutely crush MAGA. Or we might eek out a narrower than expected win. But if we relax before election day we're risking letting a narrow win turn into a narrow defeat.

There's no downside to keeping up the pressure. No lead is sufficient. We're either fighting for our lives or we're fighting to show our full power and send MAGA scrambling back to the shadows.

I share [this clip of Trump from 2015:](https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/politics/trump-has-never-sought-forgiveness/index.html)  
He explicitly says **he has never asked God for forgiveness**.  
For many Protestants, this is the PRIMARY tenant of what it means to BECOME a Christian.  
  
And it‚Äôs not just once in your life ticket; you are  supposed to always ask for forgiveness for all of your sins *before* taking communion.  
And I have personally physically seen trump IN person at church take communion. He goes a couple times a year, makes a big show of it, it‚Äôs like a mile of Mar-A-Lago.  
  
Beautiful stone church, but also it is Episcopal; but publicly trump always says he‚Äôs a Presbyterian. It is intentionally deceitful, because someone told him that the majority of Christians wouldn‚Äôt like it if they knew he attended (or believed lol) Episcopal church.  
  
Obviously this doesn‚Äôt matter for most people, but it actually DOES seem to poke through to some religious people in my experience.  
Especially if you can also share that Biden has literally been seen in church every week for half a century, and admits he has asked forgiveness.  
They often don‚Äôt love trump, but they think he‚Äôs gods chosen one because of ‚Äúabortion‚Äù so they have no other choice.  
If you can present to them that he has been lying about his Christian beliefs, or intentionally sharing sales witness directly to THEM, it can snap them out of the brainwashing for a moment.

Subject:  Immediate Action Needed to Investigate Unauthorized Access to Federal Systems

Body:

Greetings,

I am writing to express my deep concern over Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gaining unauthorized access to federal payment systems, including Social Security and Medicare disbursements. This group of unelected, unvetted individuals‚Äîsome as young as 19‚Äînow has access to critical government infrastructure without proper security clearances.

This is a serious national security breach that cannot be ignored. Reports indicate that DOGE has:
	‚Ä¢	Locked out career federal employees from government systems.
	‚Ä¢	Accessed classified USAID information without clearance.
	‚Ä¢	Potentially installed AI-driven modifications to payment systems and federal databases.

If Congress does not act immediately, the U.S. government is at risk of being permanently compromised by private, unaccountable actors. This is not just about ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù‚Äîthis is a dangerous precedent that undermines constitutional governance.

I urge you to:
	1.	Call for immediate Congressional hearings to investigate what DOGE has accessed and installed.
	2.	Demand cybersecurity audits to determine if unauthorized software or AI has been embedded in federal systems.
	3.	Push for an FBI and DHS investigation into potential security violations.
	4.	Hold accountable those who granted Musk this access without proper oversight.

If this situation is not addressed now, it will only escalate. The integrity of our government is at stake. Please take swift action to restore lawful control over federal systems before it is too late.",,1,1738572420.0,False

This was a do-or-die election for Trump, prison, and Republicans. And for experience with infiltration and questionable schemes they had Peter Thiel at hand. One firmware hack per COLLATION system = the rigged elections they have claimed since 2015.

Saturday morning updates from Bloomberg and Reuters: Trump is at 74,173,616. Similar to 2020. Harris stands at 70,259,160 = 11 million fewer votes than Biden in 2020 = minus 13.5% = a collapse for Democratic Party GOTV.

OTOH: Abortion amendments were not affected. Florida is shocking with 6,066,081 votes for Amendment 4 but only 4,677,502 tallied for Harris at the COLLATION machines.

Results at the battleground states are fundamentally uniform. Not set up like Texas and Florida. Set up almost exactly like each other, excepting Arizona.

If more people had voted, Trump would have lost in 2016 by landslide. Republicans are TERRIFIED of high voter turnout. They have admitted that quite openly

Vance is a slime but honestly I appreciate both of the men‚Äôs demeanor and mutual respect.

Waltz spoke to the people. He was real, down to earth and the attempt to find some dirt on him was honestly ridiculous. 

Vance speech was more polished, definitely the cadence and the choice of words made the flow enjoyable. But that is what being good at debate is. I had a classmate who would get amazing grades in some exams because he was a great speaker. He was able to bamboozle the teacher by saying absolutely nothing yet eloquently ü§£

I am embarrassed to admit that I enjoyed listening to Vance‚Äôs ability to publicly speak. However, once you get past the debate team vibe, he is all smoke and no roast.

After this analysis that no one asked for, I can say the VP debate IMO offered a glimpse of a vision for the future. Tim Waltz and Kamala Harris are more open and willing to cooperate with the people AND the republicans for the greater good.

1emgrm5,lh4nmel,"Grew up in a red state, in a GOP family. My grandparents were party operatives; very active on local campaigns and local fundraising, and eventually when one of their local boys gained some popularity helped him win a state legislative seat and after than helped run his campaign for congress (which he lost). Dude is finishing up his career as a town councilman now. Dad was the sort of guy that injected Limbaugh into his veins. Kinda guy that back in 2008 when you asked him what was so terrible about Obama would just get red faces and throw his hands up and the air and scream ‚ÄòHUSSEIN‚Äô til his neck veins bulged. 

All this to say, I grew up pretty heavily influenced by GOP rhetoric. I bought into trickle down, bought into ‚Äòpersonal responsibility‚Äô bought into small government. I was the kid in HS that would genuinely mindlessly parrot some of the truly awful shit I heard from my family, like how we should just nuke the Middle East and be done with it. Literally no thought given to the fact that real people lived there who were subjected to the awful conditions inflicted by their governments. And honestly I‚Äôm hindsight I think it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs no room in modern conservatism for empathy. It‚Äôs a very self-centered ideology. Do the things that are good for me and mine, and every one else can get bent. 

And then I went to college, and begrudgingly sat through a 100 level English composition class that was a prerequisite for basically everyone. And I say begrudgingly because I was a really strong writer throughout high school. Even at the time I graduated university I considered that class to be the single biggest waste of time and money because it didn‚Äôt equip me with marketable skills I could put on a resume. 

In hindsight though, that was the best class I‚Äôve ever taken, and it single-handedly equipped me to take responsibility for my thinking, my beliefs, and ultimately my life.

And it‚Äôs all because I was fortunate enough to draw the professor that placed extraordinary importance on critical thinking. I struggled mightily with the course initially, to my befuddlement, because I was great at researching issues and thoughtfully putting ideas on paper. But what I had never done was put myself into those thoughts, or put myself onto paper, and he taught me how to do that. He taught me how to question different perspectives, be cognizant of the motivations of different authors or authors with a specific perspective, and ultimately how to question everything in life that gets presented as simple fact. How to question or at least be aware of the motivations of every one I might ever encounter in life.  

Unknowingly at the time, I started questioning all sorts of stuff in my life, including politics. I started questioning my positions on issues. I started asking myself if I really believed in equality, why shouldn‚Äôt gay people be able to marry? Previously I‚Äôd been in favor of civil unions, but I asked myself why we need to allow for equal rights in terms of what makes the religious right comfortable?  I graduated in the midst of the financial crisis in the late aughts. I began to question the ethics behind the way bangs and large financial firms are allowed to operate here, no longer simply believing that they were the great engines that drove our economy. I began asking why republicans were climate change deniers, when data plainly states that it‚Äôs real. I asked why Obamacare was ‚Äòcommunist‚Äô and destroying America, but it was perfectly acceptable to spend hundreds of billions annually on ‚Äòdefense‚Äô budgets, converting our money into the skeletons of middle eastern children. 

I‚Äôm ashamed to say that i voted GOP up until 2016. I was close to overcoming my cognitive dissonance, but hatred of the Clinton family had been burned into me from a young age. I wouldn‚Äôt vote for Trump, but also couldn‚Äôt bring myself to vote for Clinton. So I voted 3rd party. 

During the Trump administration i became very quickly radicalized. Ultimately the stuff that shattered my dissonance was stuff that very plainly broke the ‚ÄòGOP is for small government‚Äô narrative, which was an idea that I was and in some ways still am sympathetic to. 

There were alot of small things, but the one that really got me was the expansion of ICE agents. Trump dramatically increased the number of armed enforcement agents, and i quickly learned how these agents are allowed and encouraged to operate outside of the bounds of the constitution. On its face it‚Äôs because ‚Äòillegal immigrants‚Äô shouldn‚Äôt have rights according to the right, so ICE needs to be able to do what‚Äôs necessary to round these folks up within 100 miles of any international border. In reality, they‚Äôre just looking for excuses to stuff people into for profit prisons that are campaign donors for GOP politicians. Additionally, thousands of American citizens have also been rounded up this way, some of whom were illegally detained for multiple YEARS in these hell holes with no way to contact their families. And the only justification required was for an ICE agent to think that citizen ‚Äòlooked like an illegal‚Äô. It‚Äôs literally the most egregious violation of small government values I could imagine, and it completely shattered the illusion for me. 

Now I consider myself a small ‚ÄòL‚Äô libertarian, which is to say that I believe in protecting liberty for real every day people; not like American Libertarianism which is mostly just the GOP in a sovereign citizen mask. People need to be protected, not corps. People need rights, not corps. Corps need to work for us, and politicians need to work for us. I‚Äôm for policy that helps regular folks- education, labor rights, union right, universal healthcare, stronger antitrust law and enforcement, more regulation on corporations, the financial industry in particular. Penalties for corps that send jobs overseas. Pro public infrastructure and pro green and nuclear infrastructure. 

The democrats Rick many of those boxes, and the GOP tick none",zytz,1,1723133956.0,False
1emgrm5,lh4klwu,"I was raised in an extremely conservative community, was raised in an evangelical community, and my biological father is politically very far right. My mom is an Independent. I registered as a Republican because I didn‚Äôt really have a choice. He didn‚Äôt give me one - I could be a Conservative or a Republican. The Republicans were less extreme than the Conservatives back then, so that‚Äôs why I chose them. It was expected that you would register (or not register) to vote and vote in line with the man of the family in our evangelical community. 

Fast forward to 2016. I was freshly out of the Army after an injury ended my career early. The parents of Captain Humayan Khan spoke at the DNC and Trump was quick to attack them, especially his mom. I read an op-ed by his mom, who strongly condemned Trump and talked about her son and all the pain that losing him caused. She reminded me of my own mom and how scared she was when I almost died not all that long before that day. 

I changed my registration to the Democratic Party not long after. Her words helped me understand the discomfort that Trump‚Äôs behavior had been causing me: he was attacking people and families who were what I could have been. In a single second, a soldier can become a POW or their family may become a Gold Star family. Him saying that stuff wasn‚Äôt even the worst part about it - the fact that every single person around him wasn‚Äôt immediately condemning him for it was. It reminded me of a quote from MLK that I had learned in high school: ‚ÄúThe ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people.‚Äù 

I couldn‚Äôt remain in a party that allowed a person to say such nasty things and not do anything about it. I joined the one party where I saw people immediately saying that Trump‚Äôs words were unacceptable - the Democratic Party.

v9744s,idspdtq,"THESE WORDS OF JOHN PALOVITZ
ARE WORTH READING AND PAYING ATTENTION TO‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Pastor John Pavlovitz: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a pastor in the church for over two decades, much of that in predominantly white churches in the American South.

I‚Äôve spent countless hours in church staff meetings and men‚Äôs Bible studies and youth pastor conferences.

I‚Äôve stayed connected on social media with thousands of people still there in those churches. I read what they share and post and amplify and I know how they think and what they believe.

I need you to understand something and I say it without any hyperbole: white Evangelicals need to be stopped, now.

If the 2022 midterms elections allow Republicans to gain control of Congress, Conservative Christians will decimate this nation, and LGBTQ people, Muslims, women, people of color, and non-Christians will never have equality under the law again. We will all be at their mercy‚Äîand they will no longer have use for mercy.

This is not alarmist, sky-is-falling histrionics, it is the clear and sober forecast from someone who knows these people better than anyone. Over the last decade and a half, as my theology shifted and my beliefs grew more and more progressive, I‚Äôve been a kind of undercover Liberal in an increasingly extremist movement, that while once relegated to minor fringe noisemakers is now at the precipice of Roman Empire-level power. They are less than two years away from having a dominance that they will wield violently and not relinquish.

I watched it all unfold from the inside:

I was at a North Carolina megachurch when Obama was elected and I saw the shift take place firsthand. I saw the fear slowly being ratcheted up and the agenda become solidified and the prejudices leveraged.
I was speaking regularly at the Billy Graham headquarters when Fox News reporters and Republicans like Sarah Palin started walking the halls with frequency.
I saw the messages at pastor‚Äôs conferences grow more incendiary and urgent, and heard the supremacist dog whistles become louder and more frequent.
While many decent people around this nation celebrated the progress of a black president and the many civil and human rights victories and gradually let down their guard‚Äîthe white Conservative church set off the alarms and prepared for a holy war.

Yet, they were still a largely powerless, dying dinosaur until 2016, when Donald Trump acquired the presidency and gave the Evangelicals the perfect amoral partner to serve as the biggest bully pulpit they‚Äôve ever had. Combine that with a fragmented Left, a general fatigue by the larger population, a ceremonial victory in Congress (thanks to Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema), and Republican attacks on voters‚Äô rights‚Äî and we are now a hair‚Äôs breadth from the subjugation of diverse humanity here.

These are not followers of Jesus despite the trappings and window dressing. They are Jesus-less extremists: blind zealots for nothing but power. They have been conditioned by decades of polluted theology and FoxNews alternative facts to see diversity as a threat, to see progress as attacks on America, and to interpret more people being treated with dignity as oppression of white people.

Trust me when I tell you that we won‚Äôt recover from the theocracy Evangelicals are constructing once it is established. If we fail in 2022, they will have a political power that will render every election null and void, and we will never have a voice again in our lifetimes.

Women will lose autonomy over their own bodies.
LGBTQ people will have the rights to marry and adopt taken away.
People of color will be fully squeezed out of the electoral process.
Immigrants will be denied access to opportunity and refuge here.
These are not creative projections. They are precisely what Evangelicals have repeatedly stated as their intentions, and they‚Äôre closer than they‚Äôve ever been to having a rubber stamp.

We can still stop it, though.
We just need a unity and coordination that transcends theirs.
We need a sustained, passionate, dedicated defense of humanity that rivals their relentless assaults on it.

I hear many people say they‚Äôre terrified, but being terrified alone doesn‚Äôt do anything but help these people.
Be terrified and get angry.
Be terrified and get busy.
Be terrified and go to work.
Be terrified and fight like hell.

I wish more decent people in America remembered they are among the vast majority instead of acting as if they are helpless victims of Republican Christians. We could defeat them, and we need to. We just need to stop lamenting how much damage they are doing and start doing something to oppose them.

We‚Äôve seen this play out throughout history and we know how it ends. We know what unchecked religious extremist is capable of and we know the cost of the silence and inaction of good people. We also know what people are capable of when they refuse to accept fascism and white supremacy cloaked in the Bible and wrapped in the flag, when they fight for something inherently good together.

As someone who knows just how much these Christians have lost the plot of their faith tradition, believe me when I tell you that they cannot be allowed to steer this nation. It will not end well for the disparate people who call it home or who one day wish to.

Love and equity and diversity are in the balance.

It‚Äôs time we made a choice.

It may be the last one we get.‚Äù

In fact, Democratic candidates received about 4 million more votes than the Republican candidates (about 9 points overall). That is a strong rebuke of Trump and his politics in Urban and Suburban districts. Democrats must show again what responsible leadership looks like. While I am not a member of the House and the Democratic leadership, I think their first priorities should be as follows:

1) Governmental Accountability and Ethics Reform - strong legislation to hold members and appointees to task for abusing the public trust.

2) A New Voting Rights Legislation - improve ballot network security, require paper trails, automatic audits of at least 10% of precincts, automatic recounts at 1% difference, ban with penalties misinformation about election details, penalties for voter suppress (like only putting 3 machines or broken machines in a majority-black precinct), penalties for machines than miscount votes (punish the manufacturer), prevent voter purges, ban robocalls, automatic voter registration at 18, and other good ideas.

3) Reinstate Net Neutrality, strength protections for pre-existing conditions, replace cost-sharing reductions to lower premiums, and I am sure that I am forgetting some major items.

Most importantly, Democrats will take over the leadership of Congressional Committees. No longer will the abuses of the Trump administration be covered up by the Legislative branch. There are certain things that should be investigated - like the response to Puerto Rico or the abuse against migrant children by taking them from their families.

Don‚Äôt relive 2016. Don‚Äôt get complacent. Get out of your comfort zone.

Talk to friends and family and sell them on Harris.

She has an economic plan approved by hundreds of economists.

It‚Äôs comprehensive. And she doesn‚Äôt just say ‚Äútariffs, tariffs, tariffs ‚Äú because unlike Trump, she understands that would make imports more expensive for Americans and lead to higher inflation.

Plus she doesn‚Äôt threaten to end the first amendment like Trump has when he threatened to imprison journalists, critics and non-Christians.

Plus she doesn‚Äôt threaten to end the Second amendment like when he said in Feb 2018 ‚Äútake the guns first, due process later.‚Äù

Plus she doesn‚Äôt threaten to terminate the entire Constitution like Trump did in December 2022.  you know, the whole ‚Äúwe the people ‚Äú document folks have on their bumper sticker.

Jon Stewart did a really good segment on how the candidates are being warped by the media.

And, you'd think with all that practice he'd be good at lying by now but he can't even keep his lies straight from one hour to the next.

Why do people keep forgetting this.

When you tell a lie you insult the intelligence of the person you are lying to and you destroy your own credibility.

**When Donald Trump lies he destroys America's credibility, and our place in the world.**

**AND HE INSULTS THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOU, HIS BASE,**

gd2sia,fpgv9ct,"*Full text if paywalled for you; written by Fintan O‚ÄôToole*:

Over more than two centuries, the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity.

However bad things are for most other rich democracies, it is hard not to feel sorry for Americans. Most of them did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Yet they are locked down with a malignant narcissist who, instead of protecting his people from Covid-19, has amplified its lethality. The country Trump promised to make great again has never in its history seemed so pitiful.

Will American prestige ever recover from this shameful episode? The US went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming, the world‚Äôs best concentration of medical and scientific expertise, effectively limitless financial resources, a military complex with stunning logistical capacity and most of the world‚Äôs leading technology corporations. Yet it managed to make itself the global epicentre of the pandemic.

As the American writer George Packer puts it in the current edition of the Atlantic, ‚ÄúThe United States reacted ... like Pakistan or Belarus ‚Äì like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.‚Äù

It is one thing to be powerless in the face of a natural disaster, quite another to watch vast power being squandered in real time ‚Äì wilfully, malevolently, vindictively. It is one thing for governments to fail (as, in one degree or another, most governments did), quite another to watch a ruler and his supporters actively spread a deadly virus. Trump, his party, and Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs Fox News became vectors of the pestilence.

The grotesque spectacle of the president openly inciting people (some of them armed) to take to the streets to oppose the restrictions that save lives is the manifestation of a political death wish. What are supposed to be daily briefings on the crisis,
demonstrative of national unity in the face of a shared challenge, have been used by Trump merely to sow confusion and division. They provide a recurring horror show in which all the neuroses that haunt the American subconscious dance naked on live TV.

If the plague is a test, its ruling political nexus ensured that the US would fail it at a terrible cost in human lives. In the process, the idea of the US as the world‚Äôs leading nation ‚Äì an idea that has shaped the past century ‚Äì has all but evaporated.

Other than the Trump impersonator Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, who is now looking to the US as the exemplar of anything other than what not to do? How many people in D√ºsseldorf or Dublin are wishing they lived in Detroit or Dallas?

It is hard to remember now but, even in 2017, when Trump took office, the conventional wisdom in the US was that the Republican Party and the broader framework of US political institutions would prevent him from doing too much damage. This was always a delusion, but the pandemic has exposed it in the most savage ways.

What used to be called mainstream conservatism has not absorbed Trump ‚Äì he has absorbed it. Almost the entire right-wing half of American politics has surrendered abjectly to him. It has sacrificed on the altar of wanton stupidity the most basic ideas of responsibility, care and even safety.

Thus, even at the very end of March, 15 Republican governors had failed to order people to stay at home or to close non-essential businesses. In Alabama, for example, it was not until April 3 that governor Kay Ivey finally issued a stay-at-home order.

In Florida, the state with the highest concentration of elderly people with underlying conditions, governor Ron DeSantis, a Trump mini-me, kept the beach resorts open to students travelling from all over the US for spring break parties. Even on April 1, when he issued restrictions, DeSantis exempted religious services and ‚Äúrecreational activities.‚Äù

Georgia governor Brian Kemp, when he finally issued a stay-at-home order on April 1, explained: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know that [the virus can be spread by people without symptoms] until the last 24 hours.‚Äù

This is not mere ignorance ‚Äì it is deliberate and homicidal stupidity. There is, as the demonstrations this week in US cities have shown, plenty of political mileage in denying the reality of the pandemic. It is fuelled by Fox News and far-right internet sites, and it reaps for these politicians millions of dollars in donations, mostly (in an ugly irony) from older people who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

It draws on a concoction of conspiracy theories, hatred of science, paranoia about the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù and religious providentialism (God will protect the good folks) that is now very deeply infused in the mindset of the American right.

Trump embodies and enacts this mindset, but he did not invent it. The US response to the coronavirus crisis has been paralysed by a contradiction that the Republicans have inserted into the heart of US democracy. On the one hand, they want to control all the levers of governmental power. On the other they have created a popular base by playing on the notion that government is innately evil and must not be trusted.

The contradiction was made manifest in two of Trump‚Äôs statements on the pandemic: on the one hand that he has ‚Äútotal authority‚Äù, and on the other that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt take responsibility at all‚Äù. Caught between authoritarian and anarchic impulses, he is incapable of coherence.

But this is not just Donald Trump. The crisis has shown definitively that Trump‚Äôs presidency is not an aberration. It has grown on soil long prepared to receive it. The monstrous blossoming of misrule has structure and purpose and strategy behind it.

There are very powerful interests who demand ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù in order to do as they like with the environment, society and the economy. They have infused a very large part of American culture with the belief that ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù is literally more important than life. My freedom to own assault weapons trumps your right not to get shot at school. Now, my freedom to go to the barber (‚ÄúI Need a Haircut‚Äù read one banner this week in St. Paul, Minnesota) trumps your need to avoid infection.

Usually when this kind of outlandish idiocy is displaying itself, there is the comforting thought that, if things were really serious, it would all stop. People would sober up. Instead, a large part of the US has hit the bottle even harder.

And the president, his party and their media allies keep supplying the drinks. There has been no moment of truth, no shock of realisation that the antics have to end. No one of any substance on the US right has stepped in to say: get a grip, people are dying here.

That is the mark of how deep the trouble is for the US ‚Äì it is not just that Trump has treated the crisis merely as a way to feed tribal hatreds but that this behaviour has become normalised. When the freak show is live on TV every evening, and the star is boasting about his ratings, it is not really a freak show any more. For a very large and solid bloc of Americans, it is reality.

And this will get worse before it gets better. Trump has at least eight more months in power. In his inaugural address in 2017, he evoked ‚ÄúAmerican carnage‚Äù and promised to make it stop. But now that the real carnage has arrived, he is revelling in it. He is in his element.

As things get worse, he will pump more hatred and falsehood, more death-wish defiance of reason and decency, into the groundwater. If a new administration succeeds him in 2021, it will have to clean up the toxic dump he leaves behind. If he is re-elected, toxicity will have become the lifeblood of American politics.

Either way, it will be a long time before the rest of the world can imagine America being great again.",wenchette,1,1588610134.0,False

I told him that if the problem with a new President was just a difference in politics, then life would go back to normal, but when it has now morphed into a difference of morals and acceptable behavior.  Just the fact that a grown man cannot accept losing, that he is willing to allow others to die because of being a poor loser, and people are still following him and supporting him shows that today's adults have not shed their entitled attitude that is normally a thing of the past once they decide to be adults.  Trump has made not accepting differences between people as a holy right, when those incredible leaders of the past made acceptance of others as a requirement of being a correct and righteous person.  JFK, George W, Lincoln, Adams, Regan all were great leaders, strong in their decisions and beliefs,  but yet they were also understanding of others and the difference they brought to America. They were polite, had manners, and never would they have referred to another countries leader with a derogatory nickname, and thought of themselves as clever.  Behavior like this has encouraged others to behave rude, obnoxious, and only care for their selves.
  It will now be up to us to put our foot down and insist that our leaders conduct themselves with respect, and to uphold the oath that they swear to. To show the world that their promise to uphold and protect the US Constitution, against all who would destroy it, both foreign and domestic is the truth and can be trusted.  I find it odd that those who are advocating to overthrow democracy by denying the 2020 election results also have their motto, Make America Great Again.  I didn't think America was all that bad, if only we all could respect those who look different then ourselves.  We need to solve our policing problems, by recognizing that it is a bad few apples, not the while bushel.  And in the next election, remember we, the people, when we elect a person to an office, we are basically hiring someone to fill a job opening. When we do our selecting, select someone who has expierence. People say they are tired of politicians who have been in the job for a long time. But consider what happens when you elect someone who has never held an elected position before. Trump had never held an elected position prior to the top job, not a school board position, a Youth Sports Organization Presidency, nothing;    My spouse and I were volunteers for 40 + years in a Little League  and we had to get others to help, and we couldn't even offer a ride on Air Force 1 !",Expert_Reaction9174,1,1619327690.0,False

Colorado does this and it works. Also getting the paper ballot in advanced ensures there are no surprises on the ballot that have far reaching impact. Voters have time to do their research and vote informed.

 Mail in ballots allow studying the ballot issues before hand and still seeing unpublished surprises on the ballot come election day. It takes me a couple of hours to go through the mail in ballot carefully when in the past in a voting booth, I spent 20 to 30 minutes on the ballot tops.

It is my understanding that the amendment to the bill was to reiterate that ICE cannot detain and/or deport U.S. citizens. Which is already the law which makes this amendment is redundant. So, voting against it is just means we won't have an amendment that is redundant with what is already written law. Also, this amendment was made in response to U.S. born children being deported with their non-citizen mothers. So funds could not be used to deport citizens for any reason. Would this mean that if a non-citizen mother is deported that we separate her from her child or because the child cannot be sent with the mother that the mother should just be allowed to stay? I personally don't like the idea of separating kids from their parents and I also don't like allowing people who have entered the country illegally to remain here because it is unfair to legalized citizens.

A society forms to protect its members from threats.  If a group in that society perceives that the society fails to provide it security, that group becomes restless, then violent.

Again:  Nobody cares.  Six police officers get stabbed in Baltimore.  Well, hell, that's all the way in some other state, in a poor ghetto, somewhere that doesn't matter to *me*.
